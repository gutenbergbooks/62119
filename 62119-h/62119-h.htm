<h2>THE STORY OF THIS BOOK</h2>


<p>In my rovings and ramblings as a boy I had often skirted the old stone
house in the hollow. But my first clear remembrance of it is of a hot
summer's day. I had climbed to the crest of a hill till then unknown to
me, and stood there, hot and breathless in the bright slippery grass,
looking down on its grey walls and chimneys as if out of a dream. And
as if out of a dream already familiar to me.</p>

<p>My real intention in setting out from home that morning had been to
get to a place called East Dene. My mother had often spoken to me of
East Dene&mdash;of its trees and waters and green pastures, and the rare
birds and flowers to be found there. Ages ago, she had told me, an
ancestor of our family had dwelt in this place. But she smiled a little
strangely when I asked her to take me there. "All in good time, my
dear," she whispered into my ear, "all in very good time! Just follow
your small nose." What kind of time, I wondered, was <i>very good time</i>.
And <i>follow my nose</i>&mdash;how far? Such reflections indeed only made me the
more anxious to be gone.</p>

<p>Early that morning, then, I had started out when the dew was still
sparkling, and the night mists had but just lifted. But my young legs
soon tired of the steep, boulder-strown hills, the chalky ravines, and
burning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span> sun, and having, as I say, come into view of the house in the
valley, I went no further. Instead, I sat down on the hot turf&mdash;the
sweet smell of thyme in the air, a few harebells nodding around me&mdash;and
stared, down and down.</p>

<p>After that first visit, scarcely a week passed but that I found myself
on this hill again. The remembrance of the house stayed in my mind;
would keep returning to me, like a bird to its nest. Sometimes even in
the middle of the night I would wake up and lie unable to sleep again
for thinking of it&mdash;seeing it in my head; solemn, secret, strange.</p>

<p>There is a little flickering lizard called the Chameleon which, they
say, changes its colour according to the place where it happens to be.
So with this house. It was never the same for two hours together. I
have seen it gathered close up in its hollow in the livid and coppery
gloom of storm; crouched like a hare in winter under a mask of snow;
dark and silent beneath the changing sparkle of the stars; and like
a palace out of an Arabian tale in the milky radiance of the moon.
<span class="smcap">Thrae</span> was the name inscribed on its gateway, but in letters so
faint and faded as to be almost illegible.</p>

<p>In a sense I was, I suppose, a trespasser in this Thrae; until at least
I became acquainted with Miss Taroone, the lady who lived in it. For
I made pretty free with her valley, paddled and fished in its stream,
and now and then helped myself to a windfall in her green bird-haunted
orchards, where grew a particularly sharp and bright-rinded apple of
which I have never heard the name. As custom gave me confidence, I
ventured nearer and nearer to the house and would sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span> take a
rest squatting on a manger in the big empty barn, looking out into
the sunshine. The wings of the flies shone like glass in its shafts
of light, and the robins whistled under its timber roof so shrill as
almost to deafen one's ears.</p>

<p>Few strangers passed that way. Now and then I saw in the distance
what might have been a beggar. To judge from his bundle he must have
done pretty well at the house. Once, as I turned out of a little wood
of birches, I met a dreadful-faced man in the lane who lifted up his
hand at sight of me, and with white glaring eyes, uttered a horrible
imprecation. He was chewing some fruit stolen out of the orchard, and
at the very sight of him I ran like Wat himself.</p>

<p>Once, too, as my head looked over the hill-crest, there stood an old
carriage and a drowsy horse drawn up beside the porch&mdash;with its slender
wooden pillars and a kind of tray above, on which rambled winter
jasmine, tufts of self-sown weeds and Traveller's Joy. I edged near
enough to see there was a crown emblazoned on the panel of the carriage
door. Nobody sat inside, and the coachman asleep on the box made me
feel more solitary and inquisitive than ever.</p>

<p>Yet in its time the old house must have seen plenty of company. Friends
of later years have spoken to me of it. Indeed, not far distant from
Thrae as the crow flies, there was a crossing of high roads, so that
any traveller from elsewhere not in haste could turn aside and examine
the place if he cared for its looks and was in need of a night's
lodging. Yet I do not think many such travellers&mdash;if they were men
merely of the Town&mdash;can have <i>chosen</i> to lift that knocker or to set
ringing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span> that bell. To any one already lost and benighted its looks
must have been forbidding.</p>

<p>Well, as I say, again and again, my lessons done, morning or evening
would find me either on the grass slopes above Thrae, or actually in
its valley. If I was tired, I would watch from a good distance off its
small dark windows in their stone embrasures, and up above them the
round greenish tower or turret over which a winged weather-vane twirled
with the wind. I might watch: but the only person that I ever actually
observed at the windows was an old maid with flaps to her cap, who
would sometimes shake a duster out into the air as if for a signal to
someone up in the hills.</p>

<p>Apart from her, I had occasionally seen Miss Taroone herself in the
overgrown garden, with her immense shears, or with her trencher of
bread-crumbs and other provender, feeding the birds. And I once stole
near enough under a hedge to watch this sight. They hopped and pecked
in a multitude beneath her hands, tits and robins, starlings and
blackbirds, and other much wilder and rarer birds, as if they had no
need here for wings, or were under an enchantment more powerful than
that of mere crumbs of bread. The meal done, the platter empty, Miss
Taroone would clap her hands, and off they would fly with a skirring of
wings, with shrill cries and snatches of song to their haunts.</p>

<p>She seemed to mind no weather; standing bare-headed in heavy rain or
scorching sunlight. And I confess the sight of her never failed to
alarm me. But I made up my mind always to keep my wits about me and my
eyes open; and never to be <i>caught</i> trespassing.</p>

<p>Then one day, as I slid down from the roof of the barn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span> from amid the
branches of a chestnut tree, green with its spiky balls of fruit, I
found Miss Taroone standing there in the entry, looking out on me as if
out of a frame, or like a stone figure in the niche of a church. She
made no stir herself, but her eyes did. Clear cold eyes of the colour
of pebbly water, in which I seemed to be of no more importance than a
boat floating on the sea. I could neither speak nor run away. I could
only gawk at her, my pockets bulging with the unripe chestnuts I had
pilfered, and a handsome slit in one leg of my breeches.</p>

<p>She asked me what I did there; my name; why I was not at school; where
I lived; and did I eat the chestnuts. It appeared she had more often
seen me&mdash;I suppose from her windows&mdash;than I had seen her. She made
no movement, never even smiled while I stammered out answers to her
questions, but merely kept her eyes steadily fixed on me, while her own
lips just opened enough to let the words out of her mouth. She listened
to me with a severe face, and said, "Well, if you are happy to be here
with the rest, so much the better."</p>

<p>It was a relief when she turned away, bidding me follow her&mdash;and a
foolish figure I must have cut as I clattered after her across the
cobbled yard under the old red-brick arch and so through the porch and
into the house.</p>

<p>When I was sat down in one of the shaded rooms within the house, she
summoned the tall gaunt old maid with the cap-flaps I had seen at the
windows, and bade her bring me some fruit and a dish of cream. Miss
Taroone watched me while I ate it. And uncommonly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span> good it was, though
I would rather have been enjoying it alone. From the way she looked at
me it might have been supposed it was a bird or a small animal that
was sitting up at her table. The last spoonful finished, she asked me
yet more questions and appeared to be not displeased with my rambling
answers, for she invited me to come again and watched me take up my cap
and retire.</p>

<p>This was the first time I was ever in Miss Taroone's house&mdash;within its
solid walls I mean; and what a multitude of rooms, with their coffers
and presses and cabinets, containing I knew not what treasures and
wonders! But Thrae was not Miss Taroone's only house, for more than
once she spoke of another&mdash;named <span class="smcap">Sure Vine</span>, as if of a family
mansion and estate, very ancient and magnificent. When, thinking of my
mother, I myself ventured a question about East Dene, her green-grey
eyes oddly settled on mine a moment, but she made no answer. I noticed
this particularly.</p>

<p>Soon I was almost as free and familiar in Miss Taroone's old house as
in my own father's. Yet I cannot say that she was ever anything else
than curt with me in her manner. It was a long time before I became
accustomed to the still, secret way she had of looking at me. I liked
best being in her company when she appeared, as was usually so, not to
be aware that she was not alone. She had again asked me my name "for
a sign" as she said, "to know you by"; though she always afterwards
addressed me as Simon. Certainly in those days I was "simple" enough.</p>

<p>My next friend was the woman whom I had seen shaking her duster out of
the upper windows. She, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span> discovered, was called Linnet Sara Queek
or Quek or Cuec or Cueque, I don't know how to spell it. She was an
exceedingly curious woman and looked as if she had never been any
different, though, of course, she must once have been young and have
grown up. She was bony, awkward, and angular, and when you spoke to
her, she turned on you with a look that was at the same time vacant and
piercing. At first she greeted me sourly, but soon became friendlier,
and would allow me to sit in her huge kitchen with her parrot, her
sleek tabby cat, and perhaps a dainty or two out of her larder.</p>

<p>She was continually muttering&mdash;though I could never quite catch what
she said; never idle; and though slow and awkward in her movements, she
did a vast deal of work. With small short-sighted eyes fixed on her
mortar she would stand pounding and pounding; or stewing and seething
things in pots&mdash;strange-looking roots and fruits and fungi. Her pantry
was crammed with pans, jars, bottles, and phials, all labelled in her
queer handwriting. An extraordinary place&mdash;especially when the sunbeams
of evening struck into it from a high window in its white-washed wall.</p>

<p>Linnet she might be called, but her voice was no bird's, unless the
crow's; and you would have guessed at once, at sight of her standing in
front of the vast open hearth, stooping a little, her long gaunt arms
beside her, that her other name was Sara. But she could tell curious
and rambling stories (as true as she could make them); and many of
them were about the old days in Thrae, older days in Sure Vine, and
about Miss Taroone, in whose service she had been since she was a small
child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span></p>

<p>She told me, too, some specially good tales&mdash;as good as Grimm&mdash;about
some villages she knew of called the Ten Laps; and gave me a custard
when I asked for more. I once mentioned East Dene to her, too, and she
said there was a short cut to it (though it seemed to me a long way
about) through the quarry, by the pits, and that way round. "And then
you come to a Wall," she said, staring at me. "And you climb over."</p>

<p>"Did <i>you</i>?" said I, laughing; and at that she was huffed.</p>

<p>Boy though I was, it occurred to me that in this immense house there
must be a great deal more work than Sara could manage unaided.
Something gave me the fancy that other hands must lend their help;
but if any maids actually came in to Thrae from East Dene, or from
elsewhere, they must have come and gone very late, or early. It seemed
bad manners to be too curious. On the other hand, I rarely saw much of
the back parts of the house.</p>

<p>I have sometimes wondered if Thrae had not once in fact lain within
the borders of East Dene, and that being so, if Miss Taroone, like
myself, was unaware of it. It may have been merely pride that closed
her lips, for one day, she showed me, with a curious smile, how Thrae's
architect, centuries before, had planned its site. She herself led me
from room to room; and she talked as she had never talked before.</p>

<p>Its southernmost window looked on a valley, beyond which on clear still
days was visible the sea, and perhaps a brig or a schooner on its
surface&mdash;placid blue as turquoise. Sheer against its easternmost window
the sun mounted to his summer solstice from in between a cleft of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
hills&mdash;like a large topaz between the forks of a catapult. On one side
of this cleft valley was a windmill, its sails lanking up into the sky,
and sometimes spinning in the wind with an audible faint clatter. Who
owned the mill and what he ground I never heard.</p>

<p>Northwards, through a round bull's-eye window you could see, past
a maze of coppices and hills, and in the distance, the cock of a
cathedral spire. And to the west stood a wood of yew, its pool
partially greened over, grey with willows, and the haunt of rare birds.
On the one side of this pool spread exceedingly calm meadows; and on
the other, in a hollow, the graveyard lay. The stones and bones in it
were all apparently of Miss Taroone's kinsfolk. At least Linnet Sara
told me so. Nor was she mournful about it. She seemed to have nobody to
care for but her mistress; working for love, whatever her wages might
be.</p>

<p>It is an odd thing to say, but though I usually tried to avoid meeting
Miss Taroone, and was a little afraid of her, there was a most curious
happiness at times in being in her company. She never once asked me
about my character, never warned me of anything, never said "You must";
and yet I knew well that if in stupidity or carelessness I did anything
in her house which she did not approve of, my punishment would come.</p>

<p>She once told me, "Simon, you have, I see, the beginnings of a bad
feverish cold. It is because you were stupid enough yesterday to
stand with the sweat on your face talking to me in a draught. It will
probably be severe." And so it was.</p>

<p>She never said anything affectionate; she never lost her temper. I
never saw her show any pity or meanness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span> or revenge. "Well, Simon,"
she would say, "Good morning"; or "Good evening" (as the case might
be); "you are always welcome. Have a good look about you. Don't waste
your time here. Even when all is said, you will not see too much of me
and mine. But don't believe <i>everything</i> you may hear in the kitchen.
Linnet Sara is a good servant, but still a groper."</p>

<p>Not the least notion of what she meant occurred to me. But I peacocked
about for a while as if she had paid me a compliment. An evening or two
afterwards, and soon after sunset, I found her sitting in her westward
window. Perhaps because rain was coming, the crouching head-stones
under the hill looked to be furlongs nearer. "Sleeping, waking; waking,
sleeping, Simon;" she said, "sing while you can." Like a little owl I
fixed sober eyes on the yew-wood, but again I hadn't any inkling of
what she meant.</p>

<p>She would sit patiently listening to me as long as I cared to unbosom
myself to her. Her calm, severe, and yet, I think, beautiful face
is clear in my memory. It resembles a little the figure in Albrecht
Dürer's picture of a woman sitting beneath the wall of a house, with a
hound couched beside her, an inclined ladder, the rain-bowed sea in the
distance, and a bat&mdash;a tablet of magic numbers and a pent-housed bell
over her head.</p>

<p>Sometimes I would be questioned at home about my solitary wanderings,
but I never mentioned Miss Taroone's name, and spoke of her house a
little deceitfully, since I did not confess how much I loved being in
it.</p>

<p>One evening&mdash;and it was already growing late&mdash;Miss Taroone, after
steadily gazing into my eyes for a few moments, asked me if I liked
pictures. I professed that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span> I did, though I had never spent much time
in looking at the queer portraits and charts and mementoes that hung
thick and closely on her own walls. "Well," she replied, "if you like
pictures I must first tell you about Nahum."</p>

<p>I could not at first make head or tail of Mr. Nahum. Even now I am
uncertain whether he was Miss Taroone's brother or her nephew or a
cousin many times removed; or whether perhaps she was really and truly
Mrs. Taroone and he her only son; or she still Miss Taroone and he an
adopted one. I am not sure even whether or not she had much love for
him, though she appeared to speak of him with pride. What I do know is
that Miss Taroone had nurtured him from his cradle, and had taught him
all the knowledge that was not already his by right of birth.</p>

<p>Before he was come even to be my own age, she told me, Nahum Taroone
had loved "exploring." As a boy he had ranged over the countryside for
miles around. I never dared ask her if he had sat on Linnet Sara's
"Wall"! He had scrawled plans and charts and maps, marking on them all
his wanderings. And not only the roads, paths, chaces, and tracks, the
springs and streams, but the rarer birds' nesting-places and the rarer
wild flowers, the eatable or poisonous fruits, trees, animal lairs,
withies for whips, clay for modelling, elder shoots for pitch pipes,
pebbles for his catapult, flint arrows, and everything of that kind. He
was a night-boy too; could guide himself by the stars, was a walking
almanac of the moon; and could decoy owls and nightjars, and find any
fox's or badger's earth he was after, even in a dense mist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span></p>

<p>I came to know Mr. Nahum pretty well&mdash;so far at any rate as one can
know anybody from hearsay&mdash;before Miss Taroone referred to the pictures
again. And I became curious about him, and hoped to see this strange
traveller, and frequently hung about Thrae in mere chance of that.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, by the looks on her face and the tones of her voice,
Miss Taroone was inclined to mock a little at Mr. Nahum because of
his restlessness. She didn't seem to approve of his leaving her so
much&mdash;though she herself had come from Sure Vine. Her keys would jangle
at her chatelaine as if they said, "Ours secrets enough." And she
would stand listening, and mute, as if in expectation of voices or a
footfall. Then as secretly as I could, I would get away.</p>

<p>All old memories resemble a dream. And so too do these of Miss Taroone
and Thrae. When I was most busy and happy and engrossed in it, it
seemed to be a house which might at any moment vanish before your eyes,
showing itself to be but the outer shell or hiding place of an abode
still more enchanting.</p>

<p>This sounds nonsensical. But if you have ever sat and watched a
Transformation Scene in a pantomime, did you suppose, just before
the harlequin slapped with his wand on what looked like a plain
brick-and-mortar wall, that it would instantly after dissolve
into a radiant coloured scene of trees and fountains and hidden
beings&mdash;growing lovelier in their own showing as the splendour spread
and their haunts were revealed? Well, so at times I used to feel in
<i>Thrae</i>.</p>

<p>At last, one late evening in early summer, beckoning me with her
finger, Miss Taroone lit a candle in an old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span> brass stick and bade me
follow her down a long narrow corridor and up a steep winding stone
staircase. "You have heard, Simon, of Mr. Nahum's round room; now you
shall see it."</p>

<p>On the wider step at the top, before a squat oak door, she stayed,
lifted her candle, and looked at me. "You will remember," she said,
"that what I am about to admit you into is Mr. Nahum's room; not mine.
You may look at the pictures, you may examine anything that interests
you, you may compose yourself to the view. But replace what you look
at, have a care in your handling, do nothing out of <i>idle</i> curiosity,
and come away when you are tired. Remember that Mr. Nahum may be
returning at any hour. He would be pleased to find you here. But hasten
away out of his room the very instant you feel you have no right, lot
or pleasure to be in it. Hasten away, I mean, so that you may return to
it with a better mind and courage."</p>

<p>She laid two fingers on my shoulder, cast another look into my face
under her candle, turned the key in the lock, gently thrust me beyond
the door, shut it: and left me to my own devices.</p>

<p>What first I noticed, being for awhile a little alarmed at this strange
proceeding, was the evening light that poured in on the room from the
encircling windows. Below, by walking some little distance from room
to room, corridor to corridor, you could get (as I have said) a single
narrow view out north, south, east or west. Here, you could stand in
the middle, and turning slowly like a top on your heels, could watch
float by one after the other, hill and windmill, ocean, distant city,
dark yew-wood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span></p>

<p>The crooning of doves was audible on the roof, swallows were coursing
in the placid and rosy air, the whole world seemed to be turning softly
out of the day's sunshine, stretching long dark shadows across hill and
valley as if in delight to be on the verge of rest and slumber again,
now that the heats of full summer were so near.</p>

<p>But I believe my first <i>thought</i> was&mdash;What a boiling hot and glaring
place to sit in in the middle of the morning. And then I noticed that
heavy curtains hung on either side each rounded window, for shade,
concealment and solitude. As soon, however, as my eyes were accustomed
to the dazzle, I spent little time upon the great view, but immediately
peered about me at what was in this curious chamber.</p>

<p>Never have I seen in any room&mdash;and this was none so large&mdash;such a
hugger-mugger of strange objects&mdash;odd-shaped coloured shells, fragments
of quartz, thunderbolts and fossils; skins of brilliant birds;
outlandish shoes; heads, faces, masks of stone, wood, glass, wax, and
metal; pots, images, glass shapes, and what not; lanterns and bells;
bits of harness and ornament and weapons. There were, besides, two
or three ships of different rigs in glass cases, and one in a green
bottle; peculiar tools, little machines; silent clocks, instruments
of music, skulls and bones of beasts, frowsy bunches of linen or silk
queerly marked, and a mummied cat (I think). And partly concealed, as
I twisted my head, there, dangling in an alcove, I caught sight of a
full-length skeleton, one hollow eye-hole concealed by a curtain looped
to the floor from the ceiling.</p>

<p>I just cast my glance round on all these objects without of course
seeing them one by one. The air was clear as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span> water in the evening
light, a little dust had fallen; all was in order, though at that first
hasty glance there seemed none. Last, but not least, there was row on
row of painted pictures. Wherever there was space on the walls free
of books, this round tower room was hung with them as close as their
frames and nails allowed. There I stood, hearing faintly the birds,
conscious of the pouring sunlight, the only live creature amidst this
departed traveller's treasures and possessions.</p>

<p>I was so much taken aback by it all, so mystified by Miss Taroone's
ways, so cold at sight of the harmless bones above me, and felt so
suddenly out of my familiars, that without a moment's hesitation I
turned about, flung open the door and went helter skelter clattering
down the stairs&mdash;out of the glare into the gloom.</p>

<p>There was no sign of Miss Taroone as I crossed through the house and
sneaked off hastily through the garden. And not until the barn had
shut me out from the lower windows behind me did I look back at the
upper ones of Mr. Nahum's tower. Until that moment I did not know how
frightened I had been. Yet why, or at what, I cannot even now decide.</p>

<p>But I soon overcame this folly. Miss Taroone made no inquiry how I had
fared on this first visit to Mr. Nahum's fortress. As I have said, she
seldom asked questions&mdash;except with her eyes, expressions, and hands.
But some time afterwards, and after two or three spells of exploration,
I myself began to talk to her of the strange things up there.</p>

<p>"I have looked at a good many, Miss Taroone. But the pictures! Some of
them are of places I <i>believe</i> I know. I wish I could be a traveller
and see what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span> the others are of. Did Mr. Nahum paint them all himself?"</p>

<p>Miss Taroone was sitting bolt upright in a high-backed chair, her eyes
and face very intent, as always happened when Mr. Nahum's name was
mentioned.</p>

<p>"I know very little about them, Simon. When Nahum was younger he used
to make pictures of Thrae, and of the woods and valleys hereabouts.
There are boxfulls put away. Others are pictures brought back from
foreign parts, but many of them, as I believe," she turned her face and
looked into a shadowy corner of the room, "are pictures of nothing on
earth. He has his two worlds. Take your time. Some day you too, I dare
say, will go off on your travels. Remember that, like Nahum, you are as
old as the hills which neither spend nor waste time, but dwell in it
for ages, as if it were light or sunshine. Some day perhaps Nahum will
shake himself free of Thrae altogether. I don't <i>know</i>, myself, Simon.
This house is enough for me, and what I remember of Sure Vine, compared
with which Thrae is but the smallest of bubbles in a large glass."</p>

<p>I do not profess to have understood one half of what Miss Taroone meant
in these remarks. It was in English and yet in a hidden tongue.</p>

<p>But by this time I had grown to be bolder in her company, and pounced
on this:&mdash;"What, please Miss Taroone, do you mean by the 'two worlds'?
Or shall I ask downstairs?" I added the latter question because now and
then in the past Miss Taroone had bidden me go down to Linnet Sara for
my answers. She now appeared at first not to have heard it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now I must say to you, Simon," she replied at last, folding her hands
on her knee, "wherever you may be in that body of yours, you feel you
look out of it, do you not?"</p>

<p>I nodded. "Yes, Miss Taroone."</p>

<p>"Now think, then, of Mr. Nahum's round room; where is that?"</p>

<p>"Up there," said I, pointing up a rambling finger.</p>

<p>"Ah!" cried Miss Taroone, "so it may be. But even if to-morrow you are
thousands of miles distant from here on the other side of this great
Ball, or in its bowels, or flying free&mdash;you will still carry a picture
of it, will you not? And that will be within you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, in my mind, Miss Taroone?" I answered rather sheepishly.</p>

<p>"In your mind," she echoed me, but not as if she were particularly
pleased at the fact. "Well, many of the pictures I take it in Mr.
Nahum's round tower are of <i>that</i> world. His <span class="smcap">MIND</span>. I have
never examined them. My duties are elsewhere. Your duty is to keep
your senses, heart and courage and to go where you are called. And in
black strange places you will at times lose yourself and find yourself,
Simon. Now Mr. Nahum is calling. Don't think of me too much. I have
great faith in him. Sit up there with him then. Share your eyes with
his pictures. And having seen them, compare them if you will. Say, This
is this, and that is that. And make of all that he has exactly what use
you can."</p>

<p>With this counsel in my head I once more groped my way up the corkscrew
stone staircase, and once more passed on from picture to picture; in my
engrossment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</a></span> actually knocking my head against the dangling foot-bones
of Mr. Nahum's treasured and now unalarming skeleton.</p>

<p>The pictures were of all kinds and sizes&mdash;in water colour, in chalks,
and in oil. Some I liked for their vivid colours and deep shadows, and
some I did not like at all. Nor could I always be sure even what they
were intended to represent. Many of them completely perplexed me. A few
of them seemed to me to be absurd; some made me stupidly ashamed; and
one or two of them terrified me. But I went on examining them when I
felt inclined, and a week or so after, as I was lifting out one of them
into the sunshine, by chance it twisted on its cord and disclosed its
wooden back.</p>

<p>And there, pasted on to it, was a scrap of yellowing paper with the
letters <span class="smcap">Blake</span>, followed by a number&mdash;<span class="smcap">CXLVII</span>, in Roman
figures. As with this one, so with the others. Each had its name and a
number.</p>

<p>And even as I stood pondering what this might mean, my eyes rested on
a lower shelf of one of Mr. Nahum's cases of books&mdash;book-cases which
I have forgotten to say stood all round the lower part of the room. I
had already discovered that many of these books were the writings of
travellers in every part of the globe. One whole book-case consisted of
what Mr. Nahum appeared to call Kitchen Work. But the one on a lower
shelf which had now taken my attention was new to me&mdash;an enormous,
thick, home-made-looking volume covered in a greenish shagreen or
shark-skin.</p>

<p>Scrawled in ungainly capitals on the strip of vellum pasted to the
back of this book was its title: <span class="smcap">Theotherworlde</span>. Would you
believe it?&mdash;at first I was stupid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[xxv]</a></span> enough to suppose this title was
one word, a word in a strange tongue, which I pronounced to myself
as best I could, <span class="smcap">Theeothaworldie</span>&mdash;saying the <span class="smcap">TH</span> as
in <i>thimble</i>. And that is what, merely for old sake's sake, I have
continued to call the book in my mind to this day!</p>

<p>I glanced out of the window. The upper boughs of the yew-wood and the
stones this side of it among the bright green grasses were impurpled by
the reflected sunlight. Nothing there but motionless shadows. I stood
looking vacantly out for a moment or two; then stooped and lugged out
the ponderous fusty old volume on to the floor and raised its clumsy
cover.</p>

<p>To my surprise and pleasure, I found, that attached within was the
drawing of a boy of about my own age, but dressed like a traveller,
whose face faintly resembled a portrait I had noticed on the walls
downstairs, though this child had wings painted to his shoulders and
there was a half circle of stars around his head. Beneath this portrait
in the book, in small letters, was scrawled in a faded handwriting,
<span class="smcap">Nahum Tarune</span>. This, then, was Mr. Nahum when he was a boy. It
pleased me to find that he was no better a speller than myself. He had
not even got his own name right! I liked his face. He looked out from
under his stars at me, full in the eyes.</p>

<p>Next&mdash;after I had searched his looks and clothes and what he carried
pretty closely&mdash;I turned over a few of the stiff leaves and found more
of his writing with a big VII scrawled on the top. On page one of this
book you will find the writing. I should have been a stupider boy even
than I was if I had not at once turned over the pictures till I came to
that with VII on the label on the back of it. This picture was of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[xxvi]</a></span>
Maze outlined in gaudy colours which faded towards the middle&mdash;a sort
of oasis in which grew a tree. Fabulous-looking animals and creatures
with wings sprawled around its margins. After repeated attempts I
found to my disappointment that your only way out of the oasis and the
maze was, after long groping, by the way you went in. Underneath it
was written "<i>This is the key.</i>" And above it in green letters stood
this:&mdash;Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good
tidings, that publisheth peace!</p>

<p>It was unfortunate that so little more of daylight was now left dying
in the sky that evening; for as yet I had not the confidence to kindle
the wax candles that stood in their brass sticks in the round tower.
It was high time for me to be getting home. In my haste to be off I
nearly collided with Miss Taroone, who happened to be standing in the
dusklight looking out from under her porch. Too much excited even to
beg her pardon, I blurted out: "Miss Taroone, I have found out what
the pictures are of. It's a Book. <i>Theeothaworldie.</i> Mr. Nahum's
portrait's in it, but they've put wings to him; and it's all in his
writing&mdash;rhymes."</p>

<p>She looked down at me, though I could not quite see her face.</p>

<p>"Then, good-night to you, Simon; and happy dreams," she said, in her
unfriendly voice.</p>

<p>"I like the round room better and better," I replied as heartily as I
could. "That picture of Mr. Nahum&mdash;and there are lots more, I think&mdash;is
a <i>little</i> bit like an uncle of mine who died in Russia; my Uncle John."</p>

<p>"John's as good a name, I suppose, as any other, Simon," said Miss
Taroone. She stood looking out on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[xxvii]</a></span> the dusky country scene. "There's a
heavy dew tonight, and the owls are busy."</p>

<p>They were indeed. Their screechings sounded on all sides of me as I ran
off homewards, chanting over to myself the words that had somehow stuck
in my memory.</p>

<p>Well, at last I began to read in Mr. Nahum's book&mdash;I won't say page
by page, but as the fancy took me. It consisted chiefly of rhymes and
poems, and some of them had pictured capitals and were decorated in
clear bright colours like the pages of the old books illuminated by
monks centuries ago. Apart from the poems were here and there pieces
of prose. These, I found, always had some bearing on the poems, and,
like them, many of them were queerly spelt. Occasionally Mr. Nahum had
jotted down his own thoughts in the margin. But the pictures were my
first concern.</p>

<p>Sometimes I went off to them from the book in order to find the
particular one I wanted. And sometimes the other way round: I would
have a good long stare at a picture, then single out the proper rhyme
in the book. Often, either in one way or the other, I failed. For there
were far fewer pictures than there were pages in the book, and for
scores of pages I found no picture at all. It seemed Mr. Nahum had made
paintings only of those he liked best.</p>

<p>The book itself, I found, was the first of three, the other two being
similar to itself but much thicker and heavier. Into these I dipped
occasionally, but found that the rhymes in them interested me less
or were less easily understandable. Even some of those in the first
book were a little beyond my wits at the time. But experience seems to
be like the shining of a bright<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[xxviii]</a></span> lantern. It suddenly makes clear in
the mind what was already there perhaps, but dim. And often though I
immediately liked what I read, long years were to go by before I really
understood it, made it my own. There would come a moment, something
would happen; and I would say to myself:&mdash;"Oh, that, then, is what
<i>that</i> meant!"</p>

<p>Before going any further I must confess that I was exceedingly slow
over Mr. Nahum's writings. Even over Volume I. When first I opened its
pages I had had a poor liking for poetry because of a sort of contempt
for it. "Poetry!" I would scoff to myself, and would shut up the covers
of any such book with a kind of yawn inside me. Some of it had come my
way in lesson books. This I could gabble off like a parrot, and with as
much understanding; and I had just begun to grind out a little Latin
verse for my father.</p>

<p>But I had never troubled to think about it; to share my Self with it;
to examine it in order to see whether or not it was true; or to ask
why it was written in this one way and in no other way. But apart
from this, there were many old rhymes in Mr. Nahum's book&mdash;nursery
things&mdash;which I had known since I knew anything. And I still have an
old childish love for rhymes and jingles like them.</p>

<p>But what about the others? I began to ponder. After being so many hours
alone in Mr. Nahum's room, among his secret belongings, I almost felt
his presence there. When your mind is sunk in study, it is as if you
were in a dream. But you cannot tell where, or in whose company, you
may wake out of a dream. I remember one sultry afternoon being startled
out of my wits by a sudden clap of thunder. I looked up, to find the
whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[xxix]</a></span> room black, zigzag, and strange, and for a moment I fancied Mr.
Nahum was actually there behind me; and not a friendly Mr. Nahum.</p>

<p>That is mere fancy; though in other ways he became so real to me at
last that I would do things as if he had asked me to do them. For this
reason, I think, I persevered with his book, swallowing some of the
poems as if they were physic, simply because he had written them there.
But the more I read, the more I came to enjoy them for their own sakes.
Not all of them, of course. But I did see this, that like a carpenter
who makes a table, a man who has written a poem has written it like
that <i>on purpose</i>.</p>

<p>With this thought in my head I tried one day to alter the words of
one or two of the simple and easy poems; or to put the words in a
different order. And I found by so doing that you not only altered
the sound of the poem, but that even the slightest alteration in the
sound a little changed the sense. Either you lost something of the tune
and runningness; or the words did not clash right; or you blurred the
picture the words gave you; or some half-hidden meaning vanished away.
I don't mean that every poem is perfect; but only that when I changed
them it was almost always very much for the worse. I was very slow
in all this; but, still, I went on. No. III, I remember, was the old
nursery jingle, "Old King Cole":&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div>Old King Cole was a merry old soul,</div>
      <div>And a merry old soul was he;</div>
      <div class="i1">He called for his pipe,</div>
      <div class="i1">And he called for his bowl,</div>
      <div>And he called for his fiddlers three....</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[xxx]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, suppose, instead of these four lines of the rhyme you put:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div>Old King Cole was a jolly old man,</div>
      <div>The jolliest old man alive;</div>
      <div>He called for his cup, and he called for a pipe</div>
      <div>And he called for his fiddlers five.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>By so doing you have actually added two extra fiddlers; and yet somehow
you have taken away some of the old three's music. Or you may put:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Cole the First was now a monarch advanced in age, and of a convivial
temperament. On any festive occasion he would bid his retainers bring
him his goblet and smoking materials, and would command his musicians
to entertain him on their violins: which they did.'</p>

<p>Well, all the <i>facts</i> are there and many more words, but scarcely a
trace of <i>my</i> old King Cole, and not a single tweedle-eedle of the
fiddling. Would anyone trouble to learn that by heart?</p>

<p>Now underneath this rhyme Mr. Nahum had written a sort of historical
account of King Cole, a good deal of it in German and other languages.
All I could make out of it was this: if ever a King Cole inhabited the
world, he probably had another name; that he lived too far back in
history for anyone to make sure when he had lived or that he had lived
at all; and that his "pipe" and "bowl" probably stand for objects much
more mysterious and far less common.</p>

<p>Having the rhyme quite free to myself, I didn't mind reading this; but
if ever I have to give up either, I shall keep the rhyme.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[xxxi]</a></span></p>

<p>Having discovered, then, that every poem must have been written as it
was written, on purpose, I took a little more pains with those I cared
for least. In some even then I could not quite piece out the meaning;
in others I could not easily catch the beat and rhythm and tune. But I
learned to read them very slowly, so as fully and quietly to fill up
the time allowed for each line and to listen to its music, and to see
and hear all that the words were saying.</p>

<p>Then, too, what Miss Taroone had said came back to my mind. Even when
Mr. Nahum's poems were about real things and places and people, they
were still only of places and people the words made for me in my
<i>mind</i>. I must, that is, myself imagine all they told. And I found that
the mention in a poem even of quite common and familiar things&mdash;such as
a star, or a buttercup, or a beetle&mdash;did not bring into the mind quite
the same kind of images of them as the things and creatures themselves
do in the naked eye.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="stanza">
      <div>Now the day is over,</div>
      <div>Night is drawing nigh;</div>
      <div>Shadows of the evening</div>
      <div>Steal across the sky....</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>This was one of the earliest poems in Mr. Nahum's book. I had often, of
course, seen the shadows of evening&mdash;every grass-blade or pebble casts
its own; but these words not only called them vividly into my mind, but
set shadows there (shadows across the sky) that I had never really seen
at all&mdash;with my own eyes I mean. I discovered afterwards, also, that
shadows are only the absence of light, though light is needed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[xxxii]</a></span> make
them visible. Just the same, again, with the sailors in the same poem:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div>Guard the sailors tossing</div>
      <div>On the deep blue sea....</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>They are plain and common words, but their <i>order</i> here is the poem's
only, and the effect they had on me, and still have, is different from
the effect of any other words on the same subject. Though, too, like
Mr. Nahum, I have now seen something of the world (have been seasick
and nearly drowned) I have never forgotten those imaginary sailors,
or that imaginary sea; can still hear the waves lapping against that
(unmentioned) ship's thin wooden walls, as if I myself were sleeping
there, down below.</p>

<p>So what I then read has remained a clear and single remembrance, as if
I myself had seen it in a world made different, or in a kind of vision
or dream. And I think Mr. Nahum had chosen such poems in Volume I.
as carried away the imagination like that; either into the past, or
into another mind, or into the all-but-forgotten; at times as if into
another world. And this kind has been my choice in this book.</p>

<p>Not that his picture to a particular poem was always the picture I
should have made of it. Take for example another nursery jingle in his
book:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div>'How many miles to Babylon?'</div>
      <div class="i1">'Three score and ten.'</div>
      <div>'Can I get there by candle-light?'</div>
      <div class="i1">'Ay, and back again.'</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Mr. Nahum's corresponding picture was not of Babylon or of a candle, or
of a traveller at all, but of a stone tomb,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">[xxxiii]</a></span> On its thick upper slab he
had drawn-in an old earthen lamp, with a serpent for handle&mdash;its wick
alight, and shining up on a small owl perched in the lower branches of
the thick tree above.</p>

<p>That is one of the pleasures of reading&mdash;you may make any picture out
of the words you can and will; and a poem may have as many different
meanings as there are different minds.</p>

<p>There I would sit, then, and Mr. Nahum's book made of "one little room
an everywhere." And though I was naturally rather stupid and dense,
I did in time realise that "rare poems ask rare friends," and that
even the simplest ones may have secrets which will need a pretty close
searching out.</p>

<p>Of course I could not copy out all of the poems even in
<span class="smcap">Theeothaworldie</span>, Volume I., and I took very few from Volumes
II. and III. I chose what I liked best&mdash;those that, when I read them,
never failed to carry me away, as if on a Magic Carpet, or in Seven
League Boots, into a region of their own. When the nightingale sings,
other birds, it is said, will sit and listen to him: and I remember
very well hearing a nightingale so singing on a spray in a dewy hedge,
and there were many small birds perched mute and quiet near. The cock
crows at midnight; and for miles around his kinsmen answer. The fowler
whistles his decoy for the wild duck to come. So certain rhymes and
poems affected my mind when I was young, and continue to do so now that
I am old.</p>

<p>To these (and the few bits of prose) which I chose from Mr. Nahum, I
added others afterwards, and they are in this book too. All of them are
in English; a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">[xxxiv]</a></span> from over the ocean: but how very few they all are
by comparison with the multitudes even of their own kind. And there are
the whole world's languages besides! Even of my own favourites not all
have found a place. There was not room enough. I have left out others
also that may be found easily elsewhere. I am afraid, too, there may be
many mistakes in my copying, though I have tried to be careful.</p>

<p>Miss Taroone knew that I was making use of Mr. Nahum's book; though she
never questioned me about it. I came and went in her house at last like
a rabbit in a warren, a mouse in a mousery. The hours I spent in those
far-gone days in Mr. Nahum's round room! At times I wearied of it, and
hated his books, and even wished I had never so much as set eyes on
Thrae at all.</p>

<p>But after such sour moments, a gossip and an apple with Linnet Sara
in her kitchen, or a scamper home, or a bathe under the hazels in the
stream whose source, I believe, is in the hills beyond East Dene,
would set me to rights again. For sheer joy of return I could scarcely
breathe for a while after remounting the stone staircase, re-entering
Mr. Nahum's room, and closing the door behind me.</p>

<p>From above his broad scrawled pages I would lift my eyes to his windows
and stare as if out of one dream into another. How strange from across
the sky was the gentle scented breeze blowing in on my cheek, softly
stirring the dried kingfisher skin that hung from its beam; how near
understanding then the tongues of the wild birds; how close the painted
scene&mdash;as though I were but a picture too, and this my frame.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">[xxxv]</a></span></p>

<p>But there came a day that was to remove me out of the neighbourhood
of Miss Taroone's Thrae into a different kind of living altogether. I
was to be sent to school. After a hot debate with myself, and why I
scarcely know, I asked my father's permission to spend the night at
Miss Taroone's. He gave me a steady look and said, Yes.</p>

<p>I found Miss Taroone seated on the steps of her porch, and now that I
look back at her then, she curiously reminds me&mdash;though she was ages
older&mdash;of a picture you will find in the second stanza of poem No.
233 in this book. Standing before her&mdash;it was already getting towards
dark&mdash;I said I was come to bid her goodbye; and might I spend the night
in Mr. Nahum's round room. She raised her eyes on me, luminous and
mysterious as the sky itself, even though in the dusk.</p>

<p>"You may <i>say</i>, goodbye, Simon," she replied; "but unless I myself am
much mistaken in you, your feet will not carry you out of all thought
of me; and some day they will return to me whether you will or not."</p>

<p>Inside I was already in a flutter at thought of the hours to come, and
I was accustomed to her strange speeches, though this struck on my mind
more coldly than usual. I made a little jerk forwards; "I must thank
you, please Miss Taroone, for having been so kind to me," I gulped in
an awkward voice. "And I hope," I added, as she made no answer, "I hope
I haven't been much of a bother&mdash;coming like this, I mean?"</p>

<p>"None, Simon;" was her sole reply. The hand that I had begun to hold
out, went back into my pocket, and feeling extremely uncomfortable I
half turned away.</p>

<p>"Why, who knows?&mdash;" said the solemn voice, "Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">[xxxvi]</a></span> Nahum may at this very
moment be riding home. Have a candle alight."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Miss Taroone. Thank you very much indeed."</p>

<p>With that I turned about and hastened across the darkening garden into
the house. My candlestick and matches stood ready on the old oak bench
at the foot of the tower. I lit up, and began to climb the cold steps.
My heart in my mouth, I hesitated at the hob-nailed door; but managed
at last to turn the key in the lock.</p>

<p>With two taller candles kindled, and its curtains drawn over the
western window, I at once began to copy out the last few things I
wanted for mine in Volume I. But there were two minds in me as midnight
drew on, almost two selves, the one busy with pen and ink, the other
stealthily listening to every faintest sound in my eyrie, a swift
glance now and then up at the darkened glass only setting me more
sharply to work. I had never before sat in so enormous a silence; the
scratching of my pen its only tongue.</p>

<p>Steadily burned my candles; no sound of hoofs, no owl-cry, no knocking
disturbed my peace; the nightingales had long since journeyed South.
What I had hoped for, expected, dreaded in this long vigil, I cannot
recall; all that I remember of it is that I began to shiver a little at
last, partly because my young nerves were on the stretch, and partly
because the small hours grew chill. In the very middle of the night
there came to my ear what seemed a distant talking or gabbling. It
may have been fancy; it may have been Linnet Sara. What certainly was
fancy is the notion that, as I started up out of an instant's drowse,
a stooping shape had swiftly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii">[xxxvii]</a></span> withdrawn itself from me. But this was
merely the shadow of a dream.</p>

<p>I returned at last from the heavy sleep I had fallen into, my forehead
resting on the backs of my hands, and they flat on the huge open
volume, my whole body stiff with cold, and the first clear grey of
daybreak in the East. And suddenly, as my awakened eyes stared dully
about them in that thin light&mdash;the old windows, the strange outlandish
objects, the clustering pictures, the countless books, my own ugly
writing on my paper&mdash;an indescribable despair and anxiety&mdash;almost
terror even&mdash;seized upon me at the rushing thought of my own
<i>ignorance</i>; of how little I knew, of how unimportant I was. And, again
and again, my ignorance. Then I thought of Miss Taroone, of Mr. Nahum,
of the life before me, and everything yet to do. And a sullen misery
swept up in me at these reflections. And once more I wished from the
bottom of my heart that I had never come to this house.</p>

<p>But gradually the light broadened. And with it, confidence began to
return. The things around me that had seemed strange and hostile became
familiar again. I stood up and stretched myself and, I think, muttered
a prayer.</p>

<p>To this day I see the marvellous countryside of that morning with
its hills and low thick mists and woodlands stretched like a painted
scene beneath the windows&mdash;and that finger of light from the risen Sun
presently piercing across the dark air, and as if by a miracle causing
birds and water to awake and sing and shine.</p>

<p>With a kind of grief that was yet rapture in my mind, I stood looking
out over the cold lichen-crusted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii">[xxxviii]</a></span> shingled roof of Thrae&mdash;towards
the East and towards those far horizons. Yet again the apprehension
(that was almost a hope) drew over me that at any moment wall and
chimney-shaft might thin softly away, and the Transformation Scene
begin. I was but just awake: and so too was the world itself, and ever
is. And somewhere&mdash;Wall or no Wall&mdash;was my mother's East Dene....</p>

<p>In a while I crept softly downstairs, let myself out, and ran off into
the morning. Having climbed the hill from which I had first stared down
upon Thrae, I stopped for a moment to recover my breath, and looked
back. I looked back.</p>

<p>The gilding sun-rays beat low upon the house in the valley. All was
still, wondrous, calm. For a moment my heart misgave me at this
farewell. The next, in sheer excitement&mdash;the cold sweet air, the
height, the morning, a few keen beckoning stars&mdash;I broke into a kind
of Indian war-dance in the thin dewy grass, and then, with a last wave
of my hand, like Mr. Nahum himself, I set off at a sharp walk on the
journey that has not yet come to an end.</p>

<h4>THE QUESTION</h4>
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div>I dreamed that, as I wandered by the way,</div>
      <div class="i1">Bare Winter suddenly was changed to Spring,</div>
      <div>And gentle odours led my steps astray,</div>
      <div class="i1">Mixed with a sound of waters murmuring</div>
      <div>Along a shelving bank of turf, which lay</div>
      <div class="i1">Under a copse, and hardly dared to fling</div>
      <div>Its green arms round the bosom of the stream,</div>
      <div>But kissed it and then fled, as thou mightest in dream.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div>There grew pied wind-flowers and violets,</div>
      <div class="i1">Daisies, those pearled Arcturi of the earth,</div>
      <div>The constellated flower that never sets;</div>
      <div class="i1">Faint oxlips; tender blue-bells, at whose birth</div>
      <div>The sod scarce heaved; and that tall flower that wets&mdash;</div>
      <div class="i1">Like a child, half in tenderness and mirth&mdash;</div>
      <div>Its mother's face with heaven's collected tears,</div>
      <div>When the low wind, its playmate's voice, it hears.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div>And in the warm hedge grew lush eglantine,</div>
      <div class="i1">Green cowbind and the moonlight-coloured May</div>

      <div class="i1">Was the bright dew, yet drained not by the day;</div>
      <div>And wild roses, and ivy serpentine</div>
      <div class="i1">With its dark buds and leaves, wandering astray;</div>
      <div>And flowers azure, black, and streaked with gold,</div>
      <div>Fairer than any wakened eyes behold.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></div>

      <div class="i1">Were mingled or opposed, the like array</div>

      <div>Home was home then, my dear, full of kindly faces,</div>

      <div>Fire and the windows bright glittered on the moorland;</div>
      <div class="i1">Song, tuneful song, built a palace in the wild.</div>
      <div>Now, when day dawns on the brow of the moorland,</div>
      <div class="i1">Lone stands the house, and the chimney-stone is cold.</div>
      <div>Lone let it stand, now the friends are all departed,</div>
      <div class="i1">The kind hearts, the true hearts, that loved the place of old.</div>

      <div>Red shall the heather bloom over hill and valley,</div>

      <div>Fair the day shine as it shone on my childhood&mdash;</div>
      <div class="i1">Fair shine the day on the house with open door;</div>
      <div>Birds come and cry there and twitter in the chimney&mdash;</div>

<h4>CHRISTMAS AT SEA</h4>
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div>The sheets were frozen hard, and they cut the naked hand;</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">The decks were like a slide, where a seaman scarce could stand;</div>
      <div>The wind was a nor'wester, blowing squally off the sea;</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">And cliffs and spouting breakers were the only things a-lee.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div>They heard the surf a-roaring before the break of day;</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">But 'twas only with the peep of light we saw how ill we lay.</div>
      <div>We tumbled every hand on deck instanter, with a shout,</div>
      <div>And we gave her the maintops'l, and stood by to go about.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="hangingindent">All day we tacked and tacked between the South Head and the North;</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">All day we hauled the frozen sheets, and got no further forth;</div>
      <div>All day as cold as charity, in bitter pain and dread,</div>
      <div>For very life and nature we tacked from head to head.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="hangingindent">We gave the South a wider berth, for there the tide-race roared;</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">But every tack we made we brought the North Head close aboard:</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">So's we saw the cliffs and houses, and the breakers running high,</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">And the coastguard in his garden, with his glass against his eye.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div>The frost was on the village roofs as white as ocean foam;</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">The good red fires were burning bright in every 'longshore home;</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">The windows sparkled clear, and the chimneys volleyed out;</div>
      <div>And I vow we sniffed the victuals as the vessel went about.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="hangingindent">The bells upon the church were rung with a mighty jovial cheer</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">For it's just that I should tell you how (of all days in the year)</div>
      <div>This day of our adversity was blessèd Christmas morn,</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">And the house above the coastguard's was the house where I was born.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div>O well I saw the pleasant room, the pleasant faces there,</div>
      <div>My mother's silver spectacles, my father's silver hair;</div>
      <div>And well I saw the firelight, like a flight of homely elves,</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">Go dancing round the china-plates that stand upon the shelves.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div>And well I knew the talk they had, the talk that was of me,</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">Of the shadow on the household and the son that went to sea;</div>
      <div>And O the wicked fool I seemed, in every kind of way,</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">To be here and hauling frozen ropes on blessèd Christmas Day.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div>They lit the high sea-light, and the dark began to fall.</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">"All hands to loose topgallant sails," I heard the captain call,</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">"By the Lord, she'll never stand it," our first mate, Jackson, cried.</div>
      <div>... "It's the one way or the other, Mr. Jackson," he replied.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="hangingindent">She staggered to her bearings, but the sails were new and good.</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">And the ship smelt up to windward just as though she understood.</div>
      <div>As the winter's day was ending, in the entry of the night,</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">We cleared the weary headland, and passed below the light.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="hangingindent">And they heaved a mighty breath, every soul on board but me,</div>
      <div>As they saw her nose again pointing handsome out to sea;</div>
      <div>But all that I could think of, in the darkness and the cold,</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">Was just that I was leaving home and my folks were growing old.</div>

<h4>A DESERTED HOME</h4>

      <div>Once to the hills rolled the waves of the cornland&mdash;</div>

      <div class="i1">The songs of the young girls binding up the corn.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div>Here where the windows shone across the darkness,</div>
      <div class="i1">Here where the stars once watched above the fold,</div>
      <div>Still watch the stars, but the sheepfold is empty;</div>
      <div class="i1">Falls now the rain where the hearth glowed of old.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div>Here where the leagues of melancholy lough-sedge</div>
      <div class="i1">Moan in the wind round the grey forsaken shore,</div>
      <div>Once waved the corn in the mid-month of autumn,</div>
      <div class="i1">Once sped the dance when the corn was on the floor.</div>

<h4>THE SHELL</h4>
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div>And then I pressed the shell</div>
      <div class="i1">Close to my ear</div>
      <div>And listened well,</div>
      <div>And straightway like a bell</div>
      <div class="i1">Came low and clear</div>
      <div>The slow, sad murmur of far distant seas,</div>
      <div>Whipped by an icy breeze</div>
      <div class="i1">Upon a shore</div>
      <div>Wind-swept and desolate.</div>
      <div class="i1">It was a sunless strand that never bore</div>
      <div>The footprint of a man,</div>
      <div class="i1">Nor felt the weight</div>
      <div>Since time began</div>
      <div>Of any human quality or stir</div>
      <div>Save what the dreary winds and waves incur.</div>
      <div>And in the hush of waters was the sound</div>
      <div>Of pebbles rolling round,</div>
      <div>For ever rolling with a hollow sound.</div>
      <div>And bubbling sea-weeds as the waters go</div>
      <div>Swish to and fro</div>
      <div>Their long, cold tentacles of slimy grey.</div>
      <div>There was no day,</div>
      <div>Nor ever came a night</div>
      <div>Setting the stars alight</div>
      <div>To wonder at the moon:</div>
      <div>Was twilight only and the frightened croon,</div>
      <div>Smitten to whimpers, of the dreary wind</div>
      <div>And waves that journeyed blind&mdash;</div>
      <div>And then I loosed my ear&mdash;oh, it was sweet</div>
      <div>To hear a cart go jolting down the street!</div>

<h4>THE SALE OF THE PET LAMB</h4>
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div>Oh! poverty is a weary thing, 'tis full of grief and pain;</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">It boweth down the heart of man, and dulls his cunning brain;</div>
      <div>It maketh even the little child with heavy sighs complain....</div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="hangingindent">A thousand flocks were on the hills, a thousand flocks and more,</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">Feeding in sunshine pleasantly; they were the rich man's store:</div>
      <div>There was the while one little lamb beside a cottage door;</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div>A little lamb that rested with the children 'neath the tree,</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">That ate, meek creature, from their hands, and nestled to their knee;</div>
      <div>That had a place within their hearts, one of the family.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div>But want, even as an armèd man, came down upon their shed,</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">The father laboured all day long that his children might be fed,</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">And, one by one, their household things were sold to buy them bread.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div>That father, with a downcast eye, upon his threshold stood,</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">Gaunt poverty each pleasant thought had in his heart subdued.</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">"What is the creature's life to us?" said he: "'twill buy us food.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="hangingindent">"Ay, though the children weep all day, and with downdrooping head</div>
      <div>Each does his small task mournfully, the hungry must be fed;</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">And that which has a price to bring must go to buy us bread."</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div>It went. Oh! parting has a pang the hardest heart to wring,</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">But the tender soul of a little child with fervent love doth cling,</div>
      <div>With love that hath no feignings false, unto each gentle thing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div>Therefore most sorrowful it was those children small to see,</div>
      <div>Most sorrowful to hear them plead for the lamb so piteously:</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">"Oh! mother dear, it loveth us; and what beside have we?"</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="hangingindent">"Let's take him to the broad green hill!" in his impotent despair</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">Said one strong boy: "let's take him off, the hills are wide and fair;</div>
      <div>I know a little hiding-place, and we will keep him there."</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="hangingindent">Oh vain! They took the little lamb, and straightway tied him down,</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">With a strong cord they tied him fast; and o'er the common brown,</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">And o'er the hot and flinty roads, they took him to the town.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="hangingindent">The little children through that day, and throughout all the morrow,</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">From every thing about the house a mournful thought did borrow;</div>
      <div>The very bread they had to eat was food unto their sorrow.</div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div>Oh! poverty is a weary thing, 'tis full of grief and pain;</div>

      <div>For, from the air above, and the grassy ground beneath,</div>
      <div class="i1 hangingindent">And from the mountain-ashes and the old Whitethorn between,</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">A power of faint enchantment doth through their beings breathe,</div>
      <div class="i3">And they sink down together on the green.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div>They sink together silent, and stealing side to side,</div>
      <div class="i1 hangingindent">They fling their lovely arms o'er their drooping necks so fair.</div>
      <div>Then vainly strive again their naked arms to hide,</div>
      <div class="i3">For their shrinking necks again are bare.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="hangingindent">Thus clasped and prostrate all, with their heads together bowed,</div>
      <div class="i1 hangingindent">Soft o'er their bosom's beating&mdash;the only human sound&mdash;</div>
      <div>They hear the silky footsteps of the silent fairy crowd,</div>
      <div class="i3">Like a river in the air, gliding round.</div>

      <div>Nor scream can any raise, nor prayer can any say,</div>

      <div class="i3">By whom they dare not look to see.</div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div>They feel their tresses twine with her parting locks of gold,</div>

      <div>They feel her sliding arms from their trancèd arms unfold,</div>
      <div class="i3">But they dare not look to see the cause:</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div>For heavy on their senses the faint enchantment lies</div>
      <div class="i1">Through all that night of anguish and perilous amaze;</div>
      <div>And neither fear nor wonder can ope their quivering eyes</div>
      <div class="i3">Or their limbs from the cold ground raise,</div>
    </div>

      <div>Till out of Night the Earth has rolled her dewy side,</div>

<h4>ODE TO THE WEST WIND</h4>

      <div>O, wild West Wind, thou breath of Autumn's being,</div>
      <div>Thou, from whose unseen presence the leaves dead</div>
      <div>Are driven, like ghosts from an enchanter fleeing,</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div>Yellow, and black, and pale, and hectic red,</div>
      <div>Pestilence-stricken multitudes: O, thou,</div>
      <div>Who chariotest to their dark wintry bed</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div>The wingèd seeds, where they lie cold and low,</div>
      <div>Each like a corpse within its grave, until</div>
      <div>Thine azure sister of the spring shall blow</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div>Her clarion o'er the dreaming earth, and fill</div>

      <div>With living hues and odours plain and hill:</div>

    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div>Angels of rain and lightning: there are spread</div>
      <div>On the blue surface of thine airy surge,</div>

    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div>Of some fierce Maenad, even from the dim verge</div>
      <div>Of the horizon to the zenith's height</div>
      <div>The locks of the approaching storm. Thou dirge</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div>Of the dying year, to which this closing night</div>

      <div>The impulse of thy strength, only less free</div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div>The comrade of thy wanderings over heaven,</div>

      <div>Scarce seemed a vision; I would ne'er have striven</div>
    </div>

      <div>As thus with thee in prayer in my sore need.</div>
      <div>Oh! lift me as a wave, a leaf, a cloud!</div>
      <div>I fall upon the thorns of life! I bleed!</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div>A heavy weight of hours has chained and bowed</div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div>Will take from both a deep, autumnal tone,</div>

      <div>When men were all asleep the snow came flying,</div>

      <div>Hiding difference, making unevenness even,</div>
      <div>Into angles and crevices softly drifting and sailing.</div>
      <div class="i1">All night it fell, and when full inches seven</div>
      <div>It lay in the depth of its uncompacted lightness,</div>
      <div>The clouds blew off from a high and frosty heaven;</div>
      <div class="i1">And all woke earlier for the unaccustomed brightness</div>
      <div>Of the winter dawning, the strange unheavenly glare:</div>
      <div>The eye marvelled&mdash;marvelled at the dazzling whiteness;</div>
      <div class="i1">The ear hearkened to the stillness of the solemn air;</div>
      <div>No sound of wheel rumbling nor of foot falling,</div>
      <div>And the busy morning cries came thin and spare.</div>
      <div class="i1">Then boys I heard, as they went to school, calling,</div>

      <div>Or peering up from under the white-mossed wonder,</div>
      <div>"O look at the trees!" they cried, "O look at the trees!"</div>
      <div class="i1">With lessened load a few carts creak and blunder,</div>
      <div>Following along the white deserted way,</div>
      <div>A country company long dispersed asunder:</div>

      <div>Charmed into sudden sleep for Love and Beauty's sake!</div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="i1">Oh, tuneful Swan! oh, melancholy bird!</div>
      <div class="i1">Sweet was that midnight miracle of song,</div>

      <div class="i1">To tell of pain, and love, and love's deep wrong&mdash;</div>
      <div class="i1">Hinting a piteous tale&mdash;perchance how long</div>

      <div class="i1">Wherein life dwells, transfigured, not entombed,</div>
      <div class="i1">By magic spells. Alas! who ever knew</div>

<h4>THE RAVEN</h4>
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="hangingindent">Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,&mdash;</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">"'Tis some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door;</div>
      <div class="i1">Only this and nothing more."</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="hangingindent">Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">Eagerly I wished the morrow;&mdash;vainly I had sought to borrow</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">From my books surcease of sorrow&mdash;sorrow for the lost Lenore,</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore:</div>
      <div class="i1">Nameless here for evermore.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="hangingindent">And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">Thrilled me&mdash;filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating,</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">"'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door&mdash;</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;</div>
      <div class="i1">This it is and nothing more."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="hangingindent">Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">"Sir," said I, "or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">That I scarce was sure I heard you"&mdash;here I opened wide the door:&mdash;</div>
      <div class="i1">Darkness there and nothing more.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="hangingindent">Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before;</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, "Lenore?"</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, "Lenore:"</div>
      <div class="i1">Merely this and nothing more.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="hangingindent">Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">"Surely," said I, "surely that is something at my window lattice;</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore:</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;</div>
      <div class="i1">'Tis the wind and nothing more."</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="hangingindent">Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore.</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door,</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door:</div>
      <div class="i1">Perched, and sat, and nothing more.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="hangingindent">Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,&mdash;</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">"Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou," I said, "art sure no craven,</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore:</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!"</div>
      <div class="i1">Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="hangingindent">Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">Though its answer little meaning&mdash;little relevancy bore;</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door&mdash;</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,</div>
      <div class="i1">With such name as "Nevermore."</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="hangingindent">But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">Nothing further then he uttered, not a feather then he fluttered,</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">Till I scarcely more than muttered,&mdash;"Other friends have flown before;</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">On the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before."</div>
      <div class="i1">Then the bird said, "Nevermore."</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="hangingindent">Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">"Doubtless," said I, "what it utters is its only stock and store,</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore:</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore</div>
      <div class="i1">Of 'Never&mdash;nevermore.'"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="hangingindent">But the Raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door;</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore,</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore</div>
      <div class="i1">Meant in croaking "Nevermore."</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="hangingindent">This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamplight gloated o'er,</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">But whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating o'er</div>
      <div class="i1">She shall press, ah, nevermore!</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="hangingindent">Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">Swung by seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">"Wretch," I cried, "thy God hath lent thee&mdash;by these angels he hath sent thee</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">Respite&mdash;respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore!</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe, and forget this lost Lenore!"</div>
      <div class="i1">Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="hangingindent">"Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil! prophet still, if bird or devil!</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">Whether Tempter sent or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">Desolate, yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted,</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">On this home by Horror haunted&mdash;tell me truly, I implore:</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">Is there&mdash;is there balm in Gilead?&mdash;tell me&mdash;tell me, I implore!"</div>
      <div class="i1">Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="hangingindent">"Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil prophet still, if bird or devil!</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">By that Heaven that bends above us, by that God we both adore,</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore:</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore!"</div>
      <div class="i1">Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="hangingindent">"Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!" I shrieked, upstarting</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">"Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">Leave my loneliness unbroken! quit the bust above my door!</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!"</div>
      <div class="i1">Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="hangingindent">And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;</div>
      <div class="hangingindent">And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor</div>

<h4>OZYMANDIAS OF EGYPT</h4>

      <div>Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown</div>

      <div>Tell that its sculptor well those passions read</div>

      <div>The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed:</div>

<h4>THE END OF THE WORLD</h4>
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div>The snow had fallen many nights and days;</div>
      <div>The sky was come upon the earth at last,</div>
      <div>Sifting thinly down as endlessly</div>
      <div>As though within the system of blind planets</div>
      <div>Something had been forgot or overdriven.</div>
      <div>The dawn now seemed neglected in the grey</div>
      <div>Where mountains were unbuilt and shadowless trees</div>
      <div>Rootlessly paused or hung upon the air.</div>
      <div>There was no wind, but now and then a sigh</div>
      <div>Crossed that dry falling dust and rifted it</div>
      <div>Through crevices of slate and door and casement.</div>
      <div>Perhaps the new moon's time was even past.</div>
      <div>Outside, the first white twilights were too void</div>
      <div>Until a sheep called once, as to a lamb,</div>
      <div>And tenderness crept everywhere from it;</div>
      <div>But now the flock must have strayed far away.</div>
      <div>The lights across the valley must be veiled,</div>
      <div>The smoke lost in the greyness or the dusk.</div>
      <div>For more than three days now the snow had thatched</div>
      <div>That cow-house roof where it had ever melted</div>
      <div>With yellow stains from the beasts' breath inside;</div>
      <div>But yet a dog howled there, though not quite lately.</div>
      <div>Someone passed down the valley swift and singing,</div>
      <div>Yes, with locks spreaded like a son of morning;</div>
      <div>But if he seemed too tall to be a man</div>
      <div>It was that men had been so long unseen,</div>
      <div>Or shapes loom larger through a moving snow.</div>
      <div>And he was gone and food had not been given him.</div>
      <div>When snow slid from an overweighted leaf,</div>
      <div>Shaking the tree, it might have been a bird</div>
      <div>Slipping in sleep or shelter, whirring wings;</div>
      <div>Yet never bird fell out, save once a dead one&mdash;</div>
      <div>And in two days the snow had covered it.</div>
      <div>The dog had howled again&mdash;or thus it seemed</div>
      <div>Until a lean fox passed and cried no more.</div>
      <div>All was so safe indoors where life went on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span></div>
      <div>Glad of the close enfolding snow&mdash;O glad</div>
      <div>To be so safe and secret at its heart,</div>
      <div>Watching the strangeness of familiar things.</div>
      <div>They knew not what dim hours went on, went by,</div>
      <div>For while they slept the clock stopt newly wound</div>
      <div>As the cold hardened.&nbsp; Once they watched the road,</div>
      <div>Thinking to be remembered.&nbsp; Once they doubted</div>
      <div>If they had kept the sequence of the days,</div>
      <div>Because they heard not any sound of bells.</div>
      <div>A butterfly, that hid until the Spring</div>
      <div>Under a ceiling's shadow, dropt, was dead.</div>
      <div>The coldness seemed more nigh, the coldness deepened</div>
      <div>As a sound deepens into silences;</div>
      <div>It was of earth and came not by the air;</div>
      <div>The earth was cooling and drew down the sky.</div>
      <div>The air was crumbling.&nbsp; There was no more sky.</div>
      <div>Rails of a broken bed charred in the grate,</div>
      <div>And when he touched the bars he thought the sting</div>
      <div>Came from their heat&mdash;he could not feel such cold...</div>
      <div>She said, "O do not sleep,</div>
      <div>Heart, heart of mine, keep near me.&nbsp; No, no; sleep.</div>
      <div>I will not lift his fallen, quiet eyelids,</div>
      <div>Although I know he would awaken then&mdash;</div>
      <div>He closed them thus but now of his own will.</div>
      <div>He can stay with me while I do not lift them."</div>

      <div>A passing ship at dawn had brought</div>
      <div>The news; and quickly we set sail,</div>
      <div>To find out what strange thing might ail</div>
      <div>The keepers of the deep-sea light.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div>The Winter day broke blue and bright,</div>
      <div>With glancing sun and glancing spray,</div>
      <div>While o'er the swell our boat made way,</div>
      <div>As gallant as a gull in flight.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div>But as we neared the lonely Isle,</div>
      <div>And looked up at the naked height,</div>
      <div>And saw the lighthouse towering white,</div>
      <div>With blinded lantern, that all night</div>
      <div>Had never shot a spark</div>
      <div>Of comfort through the dark,</div>
      <div>So ghostly in the cold sunlight</div>
      <div>It seemed, that we were struck the while</div>
      <div>With wonder all too dread for words.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div>And as into the tiny creek</div>
      <div>We stole beneath the hanging crag,</div>
      <div>We saw three queer, black, ugly birds&mdash;</div>
      <div>Too big, by far, in my belief,</div>
      <div>For cormorant or shag&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span></div>
      <div>Like seamen sitting bolt-upright</div>
      <div>Upon a half-tide reef:</div>
      <div>But, as we neared, they plunged from sight,</div>
      <div>Without a sound, or spurt of white.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div>And still too mazed to speak,</div>
      <div>We landed; and made fast the boat;</div>
      <div>And climbed the track in single file,</div>
      <div>Each wishing he were safe afloat,</div>
      <div>On any sea, however far,</div>
      <div>So it be far from Flannan Isle:</div>
      <div>And still we seemed to climb, and climb,</div>
      <div>As though we'd lost all count of time,</div>
      <div>And so must climb for evermore.</div>
      <div>Yet, all too soon, we reached the door</div>
      <div>The black, sun-blistered lighthouse-door,</div>
      <div>That gaped for us ajar.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div>As, on the threshold, for a spell,</div>
      <div>We paused, we seemed to breathe the smell</div>
      <div>Of limewash and of tar,</div>
      <div>Familiar as our daily breath,</div>
      <div>As though 'twere some strange scent of death:</div>
      <div>And so, yet wondering, side by side,</div>
      <div>We stood a moment, still tongue-tied:</div>
      <div>And each with black foreboding eyed</div>
      <div>The door, ere we should fling it wide,</div>
      <div>To leave the sunlight for the gloom:</div>
      <div>Till, plucking courage up, at last,</div>
      <div>Hard on each other's heels we passed,</div>
      <div>Into the living-room.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div>Yet, as we crowded through the door,</div>
      <div>We only saw a table, spread</div>
      <div>For dinner, meat and cheese and bread;</div>
      <div>But, all untouched; and no one there:</div>
      <div>As though, when they sat down to eat,</div>
      <div>Ere they could even taste,</div>
      <div>Alarm had come; and they in haste</div>
      <div>Had risen and left the bread and meat:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span></div>
      <div>For at the table-head a chair</div>
      <div>Lay tumbled on the floor.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div>We listened; but we only heard</div>
      <div>The feeble cheeping of a bird</div>
      <div>That starved upon its perch:</div>
      <div>And, listening still, without a word,</div>
      <div>We set about our hopeless search.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div>We hunted high, we hunted low;</div>
      <div>And soon ransacked the empty house;</div>
      <div>Then o'er the Island, to and fro,</div>
      <div>We ranged, to listen and to look</div>
      <div>In every cranny, cleft or nook</div>
      <div>That might have hid a bird or mouse:</div>
      <div>But, though we searched from shore to shore</div>
      <div>We found no sign in any place:</div>
      <div>And soon again stood face to face</div>
      <div>Before the gaping door:</div>
      <div>And stole into the room once more</div>
      <div>As frightened children steal.</div>
      <div>Ay: though we hunted high and low,</div>
      <div>And hunted everywhere,</div>
      <div>Of the three men's fate we found no trace</div>
      <div>Of any kind in any place,</div>
      <div>But a door ajar, and an untouched meal,</div>
      <div>And an overtoppled chair.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div>And as we listened in the gloom</div>
      <div>Of that forsaken living-room&mdash;</div>
      <div>A chill clutch on our breath&mdash;</div>
      <div>We thought how ill-chance came to all</div>
      <div>Who kept the Flannan Light:</div>
      <div>And how the rock had been the death</div>
      <div>Of many a likely lad:</div>
      <div>How six had come to a sudden end,</div>
      <div>And three had gone stark mad:</div>
      <div>And one whom we'd all known as friend</div>
      <div>Had leapt from the lantern one still night,</div>
      <div>And fallen dead by the lighthouse wall:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span></div>
      <div>And long we thought</div>
      <div>On the three we sought,</div>
      <div>And of what might yet befall.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div>Like curs a glance has brought to heel,</div>
      <div>We listened, flinching there:</div>
      <div>And looked, and looked, on the untouched meal,</div>
      <div>And the overtoppled chair.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div>We seemed to stand for an endless while,</div>
      <div>Though still no word was said,</div>
      <div>Three men alive on Flannan Isle,</div>
      <div>Who thought on three men dead.</div>

      <div>An entrance to that happy place,</div>
      <div>To seek the unforgotten face,</div>

<h2>ABOUT AND ROUND ABOUT</h2>

<div class="chapter"></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span></p>


<h3>ABOUT AND ROUNDABOUT</h3>

<p><i>In Mr. Nahum's</i> The Other Worlde, <i>as I have said on page xxx, there
were many passages written about and roundabout the poems contained in
it. Some of these I copied out. With others that I have added since,
they appear in the following pages. If the reader prefer poems and
poems</i> only <i>in such a collection as this, would he of his kindness and
courtesy ignore everything else? Otherwise, will he please forgive any
blunders he may discover?</i></p>


<h4 id="note_1"><a href="#sn_1">1</a>. "<span class="smcap">This is the Key.</span>"</h4>

<p>This jingle (like Nos. 15, 16 and others) is one of hundreds of nursery
and dandling rhymes which I found in Mr. Nahum's book. Compared with
more formal poems they are like wild flowers&mdash;pimpernel, eyebright,
thyme, woodruff, and others even tinier, even quieter, but having their
own private and complete little beauty if looked at closely. Who made
them, how old they are; nobody knows. But when Noah's Ark stranded on
the slopes of Mount Ararat, maybe a blossoming weed or two was nodding
at the open third-storey window out of which over the waters of the
flood the dove had followed the raven, and there, rejoicing in the
sunshine and the green, sat Japheth's wife dandling little Magog on her
lap, and crooning him some such lullaby.</p>


<h4 id="note_3"><a href="#sn_3">3</a>.</h4>

<p>On the one side is printed the old Scots, and on the other the best
I can do to put it into the English of our own time. According to
the dictionary the thistle-cock that cries shame on the sleepers
still drowsing in their beds is the corn-bunting&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span> a cousin of the
yellow-hammer. He has a small harsh monotonous voice as if for the very
purpose. Whereas the nightingale might seem to cry, "Nay, nay: it is in
dreams you wander. Happy ones! Sleep on; sleep on."</p>


<h4 id="note_4"><a href="#sn_4">4</a>. "<span class="smcap">I passed by his Garden.</span>"</h4>

<p>Whatever fate befell the Sluggard, I should like to have taken a walk
in his garden, among those branching thistles, green thorns and briers.
Maybe he sailed off at last to the Isle of Nightmare, or to the land
where it is always afternoon, or was wrecked in Yawning Gap. He must,
at any rate, have had an even heavier head than Dr. Watts supposed if
he never so much as lifted it from his pillow to brood awhile on that
still, verdurous scene. And the birds!</p>

<p>Indeed, to lie, between sleep and wake, when daybreak is brightening
of an April or a May morning, and so listen to the far-away singing
of a thrush or to the whistling of a robin or a wren is to seem to
be transported back into the garden of Eden. Dreamers, too, may call
themselves travellers.</p>

<p>Mr. Nahum's picture to this rhyme was of a man in rags looking into a
small round mirror or looking-glass, but at what you couldn't see.</p>


<h4 id="note_6"><a href="#sn_6">6</a>. "<span class="smcap">The Merchant bows</span>" (line 7)</h4>

<p>&mdash;(as do the happy to the New Moon, for luck), for his merchandise is
being wafted over the sea under the guidance of the Seaman's, or Ship,
or Lode, or Pole Star. It shines in the constellation of the Little
Bear, and "is the cheefe marke whereby mariners governe their course in
saylings by nyghte." To find the "marke," look towards the north some
cloudless night for the constellation of Seven Stars called the Plough
or the Dipper or Charles's Wain (or Waggon), which "enclyneth his
ravisshinge courses abouten the soverein heighte of the worlde" day and
night throughout the year. Its hinder stars (Dubhe and Merak) are named
"the pointers," because if you follow the line of them with the eye
into the empty skies, the next brightish star it will alight on is the
Seaman's Star. Close beside the second of the seven is a mere speck of
a star. And that is called by country people Jack-by-the-middle-horse.
On this same star looked Shakespeare&mdash;as did the 1st Carrier in his
<i>Henry IV</i>.: "Heigh-ho, an't be not foure by the day, He be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span> hanged.
Charles' waine is over the near Chimney, and yet our horse not packt";
and as did his 2nd Gentleman in <i>Othello</i>:</p>

      <div class="i6q">On the enchafèd Flood....</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Faintly shimmering, too, in the northern heavens is that other numerous
starry cluster, known the world over as <i>Seven</i>&mdash;to us as the Seven
Sisters or the Pleiades. A strange seven; for only six stars are
now clearly visible to the naked eye, one having vanished, it would
seem, within human memory. When? where?&mdash;none can tell. They play in
light as close together as dewdrops in a cobweb hung from thorn to
thorn. Nearby, on winter's cold breast burns the most marvellous of
the constellations&mdash;the huntsman Orion, with his Rigel and Bellatrix
and Betelgeuse; his dog Sirius at his heels. "Seek him that maketh
the Seven Stars and Orion, and turneth the shadow of death into the
morning, and maketh the day dark with night...."</p>


<h4 id="note_9"><a href="#sn_9">9</a>. "<span class="smcap">Like a Child, Half in Tenderness and Mirth.</span>"</h4>

<p>At a first reading, perhaps, this line will not appear to flow so
smoothly as the rest. But linger an instant on the word <i>child</i>, and
you will have revealed to yourself one of Shelley's, and indeed one
of every poet's loveliest devices with words&mdash;to let the music of his
verse accord with its meaning, and at the same time to please and charm
the ear with a slight variation from the regular beat and accent of the
metre. So, too, in the middle lines of the next stanza. This variation,
which is called rhythm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span> is the very proof of its writer's sincerity.
For if the sound of his verse (or of his voice) rings false, he cannot
have completely realised what he was writing or saying. When a man says
what he means, he says it as <i>if he meant it</i>. The <i>tune</i> of what he
says sounds right. When a man does <i>not</i> mean what he says, he finds it
all but impossible to say it as if he did. The <i>tune</i> goes wrong.</p>

<p>Just so with reading. So from a gay and tiny <i>Compendious English
Grammar</i> of 1780 I have borrowed these four brief wholesome rules for
reading:</p>

<p>(1) ... Observe well the pauses, accents and emphases; and never stop
but where the sense will admit of it.</p>

<p>(2) Humour your voice a little, according to the subject....</p>

<p>(3) Do not read too fast, lest [in lip or mind] you get a habit
of stammering; adding or omitting words; and be sure that your
understanding keep pace with your tongue.</p>

<p>(4) In reading Verse, pronounce every word just as if it were prose,
observing the stops with great exactness, and giving each word its
proper accent; and if it be not harmonious, the Poet, and not the
Reader, is to blame."</p>

<p>Better, perhaps, be sure of your ear before you blame the poet. But in
general, if these rules are followed, there can be little danger of
reading like a parrot, or like a small boy in his first breeches at a
Dame's school. To <i>think</i> while one reads; that is the main thing: so
as not to be, as Sidney says,&mdash;just</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="stanza">
      <div>... like a child that some fair book doth find,</div>
      <div>With gilded leaves or coloured vellum plays,</div>

      <div>But never heeds the fruit of writer's mind.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<h4 id="note_13"><a href="#sn_13">13</a>. "<span class="smcap">Comes dancing from the East.</span>"</h4>

<p>I found a story about this dancing in Mrs. Wright's <i>Rustic Speech and
Folklore</i>. It is the story of a woman who lived in a district called
Hockley, in the parish of Broseley. She said that she had heard of such
"dancing" but did not believe it to be true, "till on Easter morning
last, I got up early, and then I saw the sun dance, and dance, and
dance, three times, and I called to my husband and said, '<i>Rowland,
Rowland, get up and see the sun dance!</i>' I used," she said, "not to
believe it, but now I can never doubt more." The neighbours agreed with
her that the sun did dance on Easter morning, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span> some of them
had seen it. "Seeing," goes the old proverb, "is believing"&mdash;which is
true no less of the "inward eye." I once tried to comfort a very little
boy who was unhappy because there was a Bear under his bed. Candle in
hand, I talked and talked, and proved that there wasn't a real bear for
miles and miles around, not at any rate until we reached the Zoo, and
there&mdash;black, brown, sloth, spectacled, grizzly and polar alike&mdash;all
of them, poor creatures, were cabined, cribbed and shut up in barred
cages. He listened, tears still shining in his eyes, his small face
sharp and clear. "Why certainly, certainly <i>not</i>," I ended, "there
can't be a real bear for miles around!" He smiled as if pitying me. "Ah
yes, Daddie," he answered with a die-away sob, "but, you see, you's
talking of <i>real</i> bears, and mine <i>wasn't</i> real."</p>

<h4 id="note_17"><a href="#sn_17">17.</a> <span class="smcap">Old May Song</span>.</h4>

<p>This, like No. 2, and the next song must be as old as the dew-ponds
on the Downs. They were wont to be sung, I have read, by five or six
men, with a fiddle, or flute, or clarionet accompaniment. When I was
a boy I can remember one First of May seeing a Jack-in-the-Green in
the street&mdash;a man in a kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span> of wicker cage hung about with flowers
and leaves&mdash;with Maid Marian. Friar Tuck and the rest, dancing and
singing beside him. A great friend of mine, when she was a little girl
of eight, was so frightened at sight of this leafy prancing creature
on her way to school that she turned about and ran for a mile without
stopping.</p>


<h4 id="note_19"><a href="#sn_19">19.</a></h4>

<p>There is far too little of Geoffrey Chaucer's&mdash;that most lovable,
shrewd, compassionate, and natural of poets&mdash;in this book. There was
much more of him, I noticed, in Mr. Nahum's Tome II. At first sight
his words look a little strange; but not for long; and if every dotted
letter is made a syllable of, his rhythm will flow like water over
bright green waterweed.</p>

<p>It is a curious, though little thing, that while, among the one hundred
and seventy varieties of flowers Shakespeare mentions, he has no less
than fifty-seven several references to the rose, twenty-one to the
green grass, eighteen to violets, and even to the serviceable but rank
nettle a round dozen, he has but a scant five to Chaucer's beloved
daisy. Flowers, it is true, as says Canon Ellacombe (who collected
all such references into his delight-full book, <i>Plant-lore and
Garden-craft of Shakespeare</i>), never sweeten the Plays for their own
sake alone, and there are no foxgloves, snowdrops or forget-me-nots
in them at all. Still, had he loved daisies as children do, he could
hardly have resisted them even for "their own sake alone." Is not
bairnwort another name for the daisy?</p>

<p>"A yellow cup, it hath," says Pliny, "and the same is crowned, as it
were with a garland, consisting of five and fifty little leaves, set
round about it in manner of fine pales. These be flowers of the meadow,
and most of such are of no use at all." No use at all, none&mdash;except
only to make skylark of every heart whose owner has eyes in his head
for a daisy's simple looks, its marvellous making, and the sheer
happiness of their multitudes wide open in the sun or round-headed and
adrowse in the evening twilight.</p>

<p>Chaucer's picture portrait is well known. So is that in his own words
in the <i>Canterbury Tales</i>. But here is another, less familiar, by
Robert Greene&mdash;of "Sir Jeffery Chaucer," as he calls him. Water chamlet
is a rich coloured silken plush, and a whittell is a knife:</p>

<p>So advises Master Will. Lauson in the <i>Secrets of Angling</i>, which was
published in 1653; the ingredients (or <i>ingrediments</i> as I used to
say when I was a child) of his "gum of life" being <i>Cocculus Juliæ</i>,
<i>Assafoetida</i>, Honey, and Wheat-flour. The "that which kills the oak,"
I suppose, is ivy. But it looks as if there may have been a wink in his
eye&mdash;to welcome the green in his reader's.</p>

<p>Here, on the same theme, are a few lines from a poem by Mr. Robert
Bridges:</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="ilefth">... Sometimes an angler comes, and drops his hook</div>
        <div>Within its hidden depths, and 'gainst a tree</div>
        <div>Leaning his rod, reads in some pleasant book,</div>
        <div>Forgetting soon his pride of fishery,</div>
        <div class="i2">And dreams, or falls asleep,</div>
        <div class="i2">While curious fishes peep</div>
        <div>About his nibbled bait, or scornfully</div>
        <div class="i2">Dart off and rise and leap....</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>And these are by J. Wolcot:</p>

  </div>

<p>A less common and more skilful sport than fly, hook and bait, or even
"tickling" can afford is to share their watery chaos with the fish,
and catch them with the hands. This needs rare skill and cunning
and&mdash;a disguise! "For dyeing of your hairs," says Isaac Walton in <i>The
Compleat Angler</i>, "do it thus: Take a pint of strong ale, half a pound
of soot, and a little quantity of the juice of walnut-tree leaves, and
an equal quantity of alum; put these together, into a pot, pan, or
pipkin, and boil them half an hour; and having so done, let it cool;
and being cold, put your hair into it, and there let it lie; it will
turn your hair to be a kind of water or glass-colour or greenish; and
the longer you let it lie, the deeper coloured it will be. You might
be taught to make many other colours, but it is to little purpose; for
doubtless the water-colour or glass-coloured hair is the most choice
and the most useful for an angler, but let it not be too green."</p>


<h4>"<span class="smcap">And Birds had drawn their Valentines.</span>" (line 4)</h4>

<p>First thing in the early morning, if you go out on St. Valentine's Day,
which is the 14th day of February, you will meet, if you meet anybody,
your soon-to-be-loved one. So too the birds. In my young days, folks
sent the daintiest pictures to their sweethearts on this day. Mr. Nahum
had a drawer half full of them&mdash;with a few locks of hair and some
withered flowers. And one or two of these Valentines were of beaten
gold, with images of lovely things upon them, as if from another planet.</p>

<p>"This morning came up to my wife's bedside, I being up dressing myself,
little Will Mercer to be her Valentine; and brought her name writ upon

<h4>"<span class="smcap">Joan Strokes a Sillabub or Twain.</span>"</h4>

<p>If you would make a Lemon Sillabub (as advised by Mrs. Charlotte Mason,
"a Professed Housekeeper, who from about 1740 had upwards of Thirty
Years experience in Families of the First Fashion") take "a Pint of
cream, a pint of white wine, the rind of two lemons grated, and the
juice. Sugar to the taste. Let it stand some time; mill or whip it.
Lay the froth on a sieve; put the remainder into glasses. Lay on the
froth." Mr. Nahum must have had a fancy for Cookery Books; there
were dozens of them in his tower room. Indeed, the next best thing
to eating a good dish is to read how it is made; and somehow the old
"cookbook" writers learned to write a most excellent and appetising
English. Here is another recipe from <i>Delightes for Ladies</i>, of
1608&mdash;a dainty that would eat uncommonly well with a sillabub:&mdash;"<i>To
make a marchpane.</i>&mdash;Take two poundes of almonds being blanched, and
dryed in a sieve over the fire, beate them in a stone mortar, and
when they bee small mixe them with two pounde of sugar beeing finely
beaten, adding two or three spoonefuls of rosewater, and that will
keep your almonds from oiling: when your paste is beaten fine, drive
it thin with a rowling pin, and so lay it on a bottom of wafers, then
raise up a little edge on the side, and so bake it, then yce it with
rosewater and sugar, then put it in the oven again, and when you see
your yce is risen up and drie, then take it out of the oven and garnish
it with pretie conceipts, as birdes and beasts being cast out of
standing moldes. Sticke long comfits upright in it, cast biskets and
carrowaies in it, and so serve it; guild it before you serve it: you
may also print of this <i>marchpane</i> paste in your molds for banqueting
dishes. And of this paste our comfit makers at this day make their
letters, knots, armes, escutcheons, beasts, birds, and other fancies."
Also pygmy castles and suchlike, for dessert, which the guests would
demolish with sugar-plums.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Good thou, save mee a piece of Marchpane, and as thou lovest
me, let the Porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell...."</p>

<h4 id="note_23"><a href="#sn_23">23</a>. "<span class="smcap">The Sun arising.</span>"</h4>

<p>"What other fire could be a better image of the fire which is there,
than the fire which is here? Or what other earth than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span> this, of the
earth which is there?" So said Plotinus, and "I know," said Blake,
"that this world is a world of imagination and vision. I see everything
I paint in this world, but everybody does not see alike. To the eye of
a miser a guinea is far more beautiful than the sun, and a bag worn
with the use of money has more beautiful proportions than a vine filled
with grapes. The tree which moves some to tears of joy is in the eyes
of others only a green thing which stands in the way.... Some scarce
see Nature at all. But to the eyes of the man of imagination, Nature is
Imagination itself. As a man is, so he sees. As the eye is formed, such
are its powers. You certainly mistake, when you say that the visions
of fancy are not to be found in this world. To me this world is all
one continued vision." ... Indeed, when Blake was a child, he saw on
Peckham Rye a tree, full, not of birds, but of angels; and his poems
show how marvellously clear were the eyes with which he looked at the
things of Nature.</p>

<p>In the year 1872, an old lady might have been seen driving across the
Rye in her silvery carriage; and she came to where, under a flowering
tree, sat a small boy&mdash;the locks of hair upon his head like sheaves
of cowslips, his eyes like speedwells, and he in very bright clothes.
And he was a-laughing up into the tree. She stopped her carriage and
said to him almost as if she were more angry than happy, "What are
you laughing at, child?" And he said, "At the sparrows, ma'am." "Mere
sparrows!" says she, "but why?" "Because they were saying," says he,
"here comes across the Rye a blind old horse, a blind old coachman,
and a blind old woman." "But I am not blind," says she. "Nor are they
not '<i>mere</i> sparrows'," said the child. And at that the old lady was
looking out of her carriage at no child, but at a small bush, in bud,
of gorse.</p>


<h4 id="note_24"><a href="#sn_24">24</a>. "<span class="smcap">And Thank Him Then</span>"</h4>

<p class="p-left">&mdash;as does Robert Herrick's child, in his "Grace":</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>Here a little child I stand,</div>
        <div>Heaving up my either hand;</div>
        <div>Cold as Paddocks though they be,</div>
        <div>Here I lift them up to Thee,</div>
        <div>For a Benizon to fall</div>
        <div>On our meat, and on us all. <span class="smcap">Amen</span>.</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span></p>

<p>A paddock is a frog or a toad, it seems. To either small cold hand
there are four cold fingers and a thumb; and in old times, says
Halliwell, our ancestors had distinct names for each of the five
toes and for each of the five fingers. The fingers were called
thumb, toucher, longman, leche-man, little-man: leche-man being the
ring-finger, because in that "there is a sinew very tender and small
that reaches to the heart." In Essex they used to call them (and still
may)&mdash;Tom Thumbkin, Bess Bumpkin, Long Linkin, Bill Wilkin, and Little
Dick. In Scotland: Thumbkin, Lickpot, Langman, Berrybarn and Pirlie
Winkie.</p>

<p>And here are some more from Dr. Courtenay Dunn's <i>Natural History of
the Child</i>&mdash;a book which is graced with as handsome a frontispiece as

<p>So (if you wish) you can secretly name not only your fingers, toes,
rooms, chairs and tables, etc., but also the stars in their courses,
the trees in your orchard, and have your own privy countersign for the
flowers you like best. "Give a dog a bad name, and hang him," says the
old proverb. Give anything a <i>good</i> name, and it is yours for ever.
There is the tale of the unhappy gardener in the Isle of Rumm who
without ill intention called a snapdragon an antirrhinum. And there
arose out of the hillside a Monster named Zobj&mdash;but I haven't the space
for the rest. The gardener of course meant well; but when he heard the
Voice counting his last moments, not in common English, but in what
Wensleydale Knitters still remember of the Norse&mdash;Yahn, Jyahn, Tether,
Mether, Mumph, Hither, Lither, Auver, Dauver, Die&mdash;well, he died before
he was due, so to speak.</p>

<p>For many years I read this poem as if the accents in the first line
of each stanza fell on the first and third word&mdash;the two "I's." It
was stupid of me, for clearly the accent should fall (lightly) on the
second syllable of the "remembers." Apart from the accents or stresses
in a line of verse, there is the rise and fall of the voice, a kind of
tune in the <i>saying</i> of it. If the right tune is not caught, then the
difference is as much as if one sniffed a wallflower and it smelt like
African mimosa. And to me, as to hundreds of thousands of Englishmen,
this poem is as familiar, long-endeared and refreshing as wallflower,
Sweet William, or Old Man. This is the second or third time I have made
remarks about the rhythm, lilt or tune of a poem; and it won't be the
last. May I be forgiven, for as Chaucer wrote to his small son Louis
when he was sharing with him his love of astronomy: "Soothly me seemeth
betre to writen unto a child twice a good sentence, then he forget it
ones." As for his elders, even thrice may be short commons.</p>

<h4>"<span class="smcap">Those Flowers made of Light.</span>" (line 12)</h4>

<p>Hold up a flower between eye and sun, or even candle-flame, and it
seems little but its own waxen hue and colour. Moonlight is too pale;
the petals remain opaque. In the moon's light, indeed, blueness is
scarcely distinguishable from shadowiness; red darkens but yellow
pales, and the fairest flowers of all wake in her beams&mdash;jasmine,
convolvulus, evening-primrose&mdash;as if they not only shared her radiance
but returned a glowwormlike fuminess of their own.</p>

<p>Once, long before I came to Thrae, having plucked for my mother a few
convolvulus flowers, I remember when I was just about to give them into
her hand I discovered that the beautiful cups of delight had enwreathed
themselves together, and had returned as it were to the bud, never to
reopen. I was but a child, and this odd little disappointment was so
extreme that I burst out crying.</p>


<h4 id="note_32"><a href="#sn_32">32</a>.</h4>

<p>See just above, No. 30: and for proof of the curious obedience of words
to any bidden rhythm it is interesting to compare this poem with its
next neighbours. Mr. Frost's colt is called "a little Morgan," because
he was of a famous breed of horses of that name which are the pride of
the State of Vermont.</p>


<h4 id="note_35"><a href="#sn_35">35</a>.</h4>

<p>Only a single copy of the old play, <i>Mundus et Infans</i>, from which
this fragment is taken, is known to be in existence. It was printed by
Wynkyn de Worde in 1522; and was written roundabout 1500.</p>

<p>The lines need a slow reading to get the run and lilt of them: and
even at that they jog and creak like an old farm-cart. But the boy,
Dalyaunce, if one takes a little pains, will come gradually out of them
as clear to the eye as if you had met him in the street to-day, on his
way to "schole" for yet another "docking."</p>

<p>Clothes, houses, customs, food a little, thoughts a little, knowledge,
too&mdash;all change as the years and centuries go by, but Dalyaunce under
a thousand names lives on. It never occurred to me when I was young
to think that the children in Rome talked Latin at their games, and
that Solomon and Caesar, Prester John and the Grand Khan knew in their
young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span> days what it means to be homesick and none too easy to sit down.
Yet there are knucklebones and dolls in London that the infant subjects
of the Pharaohs played with, and at Stratford Grammar School, for all
to see, is Shakespeare's school desk. As for Dalyaunce, "dockings" are
not nowadays so harsh as once they were.</p>

<p>In proof of this, there is a passage from a book, telling of his own
life as a small boy, written by Guibert de Nogent. He is speaking of
his childhood, about the year when William the Conqueror landed at
Hastings:</p>

<p>'So, after a few of the evening hours had been passed in that study,
during which I had been beaten even beyond my deserts, I came and sat
at my mother's knees. She, according to her wont, asked whether I had
been beaten that day; and I, unwilling to betray my master, denied it;
whereupon, whether I would or no, she threw back my inner garment (such
as men call shirt), and found my little ribs black with the strokes
of the osier, and rising everywhere into weals. Then, grieving in her
inmost bowels at this punishment so excessive for my tender years,
troubled and boiling with anger, and with brimming eyes, she cried,
"Never now shalt thou become a clerk, nor shalt thou be thus tortured
again to learn thy letters!" Whereupon, gazing upon her with all the
seriousness that I could call to my face, I replied, "Nay, even though
I should die under the rod, I will not desist from learning my letters
and becoming a clerk!"'</p>

<p>Still, there were more merciful schoolmasters than Guibert de Nogent's,
even in days harsh as his; as this further extract from Mr. G. G.
Coulton's enticing <i>Medieval Garner</i> shows:</p>

<p>'One day, when a certain Abbot, much reputed for his piety, spake with
Anselm concerning divers points of Monastic Religion, and conversed
among other things of the boys that were brought up in the cloister,
he added: "What, pray, can we do with them? They are perverse and
incorrigible; day and night we cease not to chastise them, yet they
grow daily worse and worse."</p>

<p>Whereat Anselm marvelled, and said, "Ye cease not to beat them? And
when they are grown to manhood, of what sort are they then?" "They are
dull and brutish," said the other.</p>

<p>Then said Anselm, "With what good profit do ye expend your substance in
nurturing human beings till they become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span> brute beasts?... But I prithee
tell me, for God's sake, wherefore ye are so set against them? Are they
not human, sharing in the same nature as yourselves? Would ye wish
to be so handled as ye handle them? Ye will say, 'Yes, if we were as
they are.' So be it, then; yet is there no way but that of stripes and
scourges for shaping them to good? Did ye ever see a goldsmith shape
his gold or silver plate into a fair image by blows alone? I trow not.
What then? That he may give the plate its proper shape, he will first
press it gently and tap it with his tools; then again he will more
softly raise it with discreet pressure from below, and caress it into
shape. So ye also, if ye would see your boys adorned with fair manners,
ye should not only beat them down with stripes, but also raise their
spirits and support them with fatherly kindness and pity'...."</p>

<p>There was an old woodcut, hanging on Mr. Nahum's wall in his tower
room, showing a boy in the middle ages being whipped in a kind of
machine (something like a roasting-jack), and a schoolmaster standing
by, nicely smiling, in a gown. When Coleridge was a bluecoat boy at
Christ's Hospital with Charles Lamb, he seems to have had a headmaster
of this kind: "'Boy!' I remember Bowyer saying to me once when I was
crying the first day after my return after the holidays,&mdash;'Boy! the
school is your father! Boy! the school is your mother! Boy! the school
is your brother! the school is your sister! the school is your first
cousin, and your second cousin, and all the rest of your relations!
Let's have no more crying.' ...</p>

<p>"Mrs. Bowyer was no comforter, either. Val. Le Grice and I were
once going to be flogged for some domestic misdeed, and Bowyer was
thundering away at us, by way of prologue, when Mrs. B. looked in and
said, 'Flog them soundly, sir, I beg!' This saved us. Bowyer was so
nettled at the interruption that he growled out, 'Away, woman, away!'
and we were let off."</p>

<p>Coleridge tells of yet another schoolmaster, whose name, like Bowyer
and birch, also began with a B.: "Busby was the father of the English
public school system. He was headmaster of Westminster through the
reign of Charles I., the Civil War, the Protectorate, the reign of
Charles II., and the Revolution of 1688. Under him Westminster became
the first school in the kingdom. When Charles II. visited the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[515]</a></span> school,
Busby stalked before the King with his hat upon his head, whilst his
most sacred majesty meekly followed him. In private Busby explained
that his conduct was due to the fact that he could not allow, for
discipline's sake, the boys to imagine there could be a greater man
than himself alive." Quite rightly, of course.</p>

<p>There is, too, the story of the little Lion that went to school to the
Bear. Being, though of royal blood, a good deal of a dunce, Master Lion
bore many sound cuffings from Dr. Bruin on the road to learning, and
found it hot and dusty. After such administrations, he would sometimes
sit in the sun under a window, learning his task and brooding on a day
when he would return to the school and revenge himself upon the Doctor
for having treated him so sore. But Master Lion was all this time
growing up, and so many were the cares of State when he had left his
books and become a Prince and Heir Apparent, that for a time he had no
thought for his old school. Being, however, in the Royal Gardens one
sunny morning, and seeing bees busy about their hive, he remembered
an old saying on the sweetness of knowledge and wisdom, and this once
more reminded him of his old Master. Bidding his servants sling upon
a rod half a dozen of the hives, he set out to visit Dr. Bruin. The
hives were taken into his study, and the bees, being unused to flitting
within walls out of the sunshine, angrily sang and droned about the
head of the old schoolmaster as he sat at his desk. Their stings were
of little account against his thick hide, but their molestation was a
fret, and he presently cried aloud, "Would that the Prince had kept
his gifts to himself!" The Prince, who was standing outside the door,
listening and smiling to himself, thereupon cried out: "Ah! Dr. Bruin,
when I was under your charge, you often heavily smit and cuffed me with
those long-clawed paws of yours. Now I am older, and have learned how
sweet and worthy is the knowledge they instilled. This too will be your
experience. My bees may fret and buzz and sting a little now, but you
will think of me more kindly when you shall be tasting their rich honey
in the Winter that is soon upon us." And Dr. Bruin, peering out at the
Prince from amid the cloud of the bees, when he heard him thus call Tit
for Tat, he couldn't help but laugh.</p>

<p>And last&mdash;to return to Coleridge once more, who, in the bad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[516]</a></span> old days,
so far as food goes, never "had a belly full" at Christ's Hospital, and
whose appetite was only "damped, never satisfied,"&mdash;here is one of his
earliest letters (to his elder brother George), which <i>may</i> have an
(indirect) reference to Dr. Bowyer's birch:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Dear Brother,&mdash;You will excuse me for reminding you that, as
our holidays commence next week, and I shall go out a good deal, a good
pair of breeches will be no inconsiderable accession to my appearance.
For though my present pair are excellent for the purpose of drawing
mathematical figures on them, and though a walking thought, sonnet or
epigram would appear in them in very <i>splendid</i> type, yet they are not
altogether so well adapted for a female eye&mdash;not to mention that
I should have the charge of vanity brought against me for wearing a
looking-glass. I hope you have got rid of your cold&mdash;and I am</p>

<p class="left8">Your affectionate brother,</p>

<p class="r1 smcap">Samuel Taylor Coleridge</p>
</blockquote>


<h4 id="note_40"><a href="#sn_40">40</a>.</h4>

<p>This too should go to the lilt of its music, as then the accents would
come clearly. I think, in the reading of it, there should be four
stressed syllables to the first, second and fifth lines in each stanza:
" Whâr hae ye bêen a' day, m&#375; boy Tâmmy"; and "The wêe thing gie's
her hând, and says, There, gâng and ask my Mâmmy." A line of verse like
this resembles a piece of elastic; if you leave it very slack you will
get no music out of it at all; stretch it a little too far, it snaps.</p>


<h4 id="note_41"><a href="#sn_41">41</a>. "<span class="smcap">Rosy Apple, Lemon, or Pear.</span>"</h4>

<p>This little jingle and Nos. 15, 16, 68, 75, etc., are Singing Game
Rhymes, of which scores have been collected from the mouths of
children near and far from all over the Kingdom, and are now to be
found in print in Lady Gomme's two stout engrossing volumes entitled
<i>Traditional Games</i>. In these more than seven hundred games are
described, including Rakes and Roans, Rockety Row, Sally Go Round
the Moon, Shuttlefeather, Spannims, Tods and Lambs, Whigmeleerie,
Allicomgreenaie, Bob-Cherry, Oranges and Lemons, Cherry Pit,
Thumble-bones, Lady on Yandor Hill, Hechefragy, and Snail Creep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span></p>

<p>A good many of these games have singing rhymes to them. And the
words of them vary in different places. For the children in each
of twenty or more villages and towns may have their own particular
version of the same rhyme. As for the original from which all such
versions must once have come&mdash;<i>that</i> may be centuries old. Like the
Nursery Rhymes, they were most of them in the world ages before our
great-great-great-grand-dams were babies in their cradles. The noble
game of Hop Scotch, for instance, Lady Gomme tells us, was in favour
before the year I.</p>

<p>The most mysterious rhymes of all are said to refer to ancient tribal
customs, rites and ceremonies&mdash;betrothals, harvest-homes, sowings,
reapings, well-blessings, dirges, divinations, battles, hunting, and
exorcisings&mdash;before even London was else than a few hovels by its
river's side. Rhymes such as these having been passed on from age to
age and from one piping throat to another, have grown worn and battered
of course, and become queerly changed in their words.</p>

<p>These from Mr. Nahum's book have their own differences too. He seems to
have liked best those that make a picture, or sound uncommonly sweet
and so carry the fancy away. Any little fytte or jingle or jargon of
words that manages <i>that</i> is like a charm or a talisman, and to make
new ones is as hard as to spin silk out of straw, or to turn beech
leaves into fairy money. When one thinks, too, of the myriad young
voices that generation after generation have carolled these rhymes
into the evening air, and now are still&mdash;well, it's a thought no less
sorrowful for being strange, and no less strange for the fact that our
own voices too will some day be as silent.</p>

<h4 id="note_42"><a href="#sn_42">42</a>. "<span class="smcap">In Praise.</span>"</h4>

<p>The loveliest and gayest song of praise and sweetness to a "young
thing" I have ever seen.</p>

<p>"Ielofler"&mdash;gelofer, gelofre, gillofre, gelevor, gillyvor, gillofer,
jerefloure, gerraflour&mdash;all these are ways of spelling Gillyflower,
gelofre coming nearest to its original French: <i>giroflée</i>&mdash;meaning
spiced like the clove. There were of old, I find, three kinds of
gillyflowers: the clove, the stock and the wall. It was the first
of these kinds that was meant in the earlier writers by the small
clove carnation (or Coronation, because it was made into chaplets or
garlands). Its Greek name was dianthus (the flower divine); and its
twin-sister is the Pink, so called because its edges are, as it were,
picked out, jagged, notched, scalloped. Country names for it are Sweet
John, Pagiants, Blunket and Sops-in-Wine, for it spices what it floats
in, and used to be candied for a sweetmeat. Blossoming in July, the
Gillyflower suggests July-flower, and if Julia is one's sweetheart,
it may also be a Julie-flower. So one name may carry many echoes.
It has been truly described as a gimp and gallant flower, and, says
Parkinson, who wrote <i>Paradisus Terrestris</i>, it was the chiefest of
account in Tudor gardens. By 1700 indeed there were 360 kinds and four
classes of clove gillyflower&mdash;the Flake, the Bizarre, the Piquette or
picotee (<i>picotée</i> or pricketed), and the Painted Lady, the last now
gone. Its ancestor, the dianthus, seems to have crossed the Channel
with the Normans, for it flourishes on the battlements of Falaise,
the Conqueror's birthplace, and crowns the walls of many a Norman
Castle&mdash;Dover, Ludlow, Rochester, Deal&mdash;to this day.</p>

nowadays call a child or loved-one Goosikins or Pussikins, or Lambkin
Pie, or Bunch-of-Roses, or Chickabiddy, or Come-kiss-me-quick. <i>Minion</i>
means anything small, minikin, delicate, dainty, darling. Look close,
for example, at the brown-green florets of a stalk of mignonette.</p>

<p>"Haw" is an old English word meaning (?) blue or braw, and bayberry
is the all-spice tree; so this sad one's yellow hair had for comb an
uncommonly charming thing. In another version the comb is of "new

<p>"The first sense of sorrow I ever knew," wrote Richard Steele, "was
upon the death of my father, at which time I was not quite five
years of age; but was rather amazed at what all the house meant than
possessed with a real understanding why nobody was willing to play with
me. I remember I went into the room where his body lay, and my mother
sat weeping alone by it. I had my battledore in my hand, and fell
a-beating the coffin, and calling, papa; for, I know not how, I had
some slight idea that he was locked up there. My<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[520]</a></span> mother catched me in
her arms, and transported beyond all patience of the silent grief she
was before in, she almost smothered me in her embraces; and told me
in a flood of tears, 'Papa could not hear me, and would play with me
no more, for they were going to put him under ground, whence he could
never come to us again.'"</p>

<p>The first and third stanzas of this poem were (and are) my particular

<p>Edward Thomas, who wrote this poem, knew by heart most of the villages,
streams, high roads, by-roads, hills, forests, woods and dales of the
southern counties of England, and came so to know them by the best of
all methods. He walked through them on his feet; and, when so inclined,
sat down by the wayside or leaned over a farm or field gate and gazed
and mused and day-dreamed. Here is another poem of his:</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>If I should ever by chance grow rich</div>
        <div>I'll buy Codham, Cockridden, and Childerditch,</div>
        <div>Roses, Pyrgo, and Lapwater,</div>
        <div>And let them all to my elder daughter.</div>
        <div>The rent I shall ask of her will be only</div>
        <div>Each year's first violets, white and lonely,</div>
        <div>The first primroses and orchises&mdash;</div>
        <div>She must find them before I do, that is.</div>
        <div>But if she finds a blossom on furze&mdash;</div>
        <div>Without rent they shall all for ever be hers,</div>
        <div>Codham, Cockridden, and Childerditch,</div>

        <div>I shall give them all to my elder daughter.</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p><i>Not</i>, of course, to find a blossom on furze or gorse as soon as any
sun is in the year's sky, is the rare feat; and if in your wanderings
over the hills and far away you should chance on secret hidden-away
Pyrgo or Childerditch, sweet with its fragrance, then enquire for
the beautiful, happy young Lady of the Manor. As a matter of fact,
the scent of the furze-blossom is not exactly sweet, but nutlike and
aromatic. This is what Edward Thomas's friend, W. H. Hudson, the great
naturalist, wrote about it: "The gorse is most fragrant at noon, when
the sun shines brightest and hottest. At such an hour when I approach
a thicket of furze, the wind blowing from it, I am always tempted to
cast myself down on the grass to lie for an hour drinking in the odour.
The effect is to make me languid; to wish to lie till I sleep and live
again in dreams in another world, in a vast open-air cathedral where a
great festival of ceremony is perpetually in progress, and acolytes, in
scores and hundreds with beautiful bright faces, in flame yellow and
orange surplices, are ever and ever coming toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span> me, swinging their
censers until I am ready to swoon in that heavenly incense!" ...</p>


<h4>"<span class="smcap">A Stoat.</span>" (stanza 5)</h4>

<p>It is the gentle custom of gamekeepers to slaughter at sight
(though not for food) the little preying beasts and birds of the

They then nail up their carcases to a shed side, or to a barn door, or
on a field-gate, leaving them to rot in the wind for a warning to their
live mates&mdash;just as in the old days the precarious English kings spiked
the heads of traitors on the turrets of the Tower. Foxes you "hunt" to
death.</p>


<h4 id="note_61"><a href="#sn_61">61</a>. "<span class="smcap">The Howes of the Silent Vanished Races</span>"</h4>

<p class="p-left">are, I suppose, the mounds, barrows, tumuli or Fairie Hills, some of
them round, some of them long, some of them chambered, beneath which
the ancient races of Britain, centuries before the coming of the Saxons
and the Danes, buried their dead. So once slept the mummied Pharaohs
beneath their enormous Pyramids. Age hangs densely over these solitary
mounds, as over the Dolmens and Cromlechs&mdash;Stonehenge, the Whispering
Knights&mdash;and the single gigantic Menhirs&mdash;the Tingle Stone, the Whittle
Stone, the Bair-down-Man and the demoniac Hoar Stone.</p>

<p>These were utterly ancient and unintelligible marvels even when the
monk Ranulph Higden wrote his <i>Polychronicon</i> in 1352: The second
wonder, he says, is at Stonehenge beside Salisbury. There great stones
marvellously huge, be a-reared up on high, as it were gates, so that
there seemeth gates to be set up upon other gates. Nevertheless it is
not clearly known nor perceived how and to what end they be so a-reared
up, and "so wonderlych yhonged." And yet, they are but as falling
apple-blossom compared with the age of the world and the antiquity of
the Universe:</p>

<h4 id="note_64"><a href="#sn_64">64</a>.</h4>

<p>A tragic tale is hidden, rather than told, in this old Scottish ballad.
It resembles a half ruinous house in a desolate country, dense green
with briar and bramble, echoing with wild voices&mdash;its memories gone.
Mr. Nahum's picture for it was of a figure in a woman's bright clothes
and scarlet hood, but with what looked to me like the head of his own
skeleton deep within the hood. And on a stone nearby sat a little
winged boy.</p>


<h4 id="note_66"><a href="#sn_66">66</a>. "<span class="smcap">Her High-born Kinsman.</span>"</h4>

<p>... And there was a wind in the night as they fared onward, a wind in
the mid-air, playing from out the clouds. And presently after, the
twain descended into the valley, the one traveller's foot stumbling as
he went, against the writhen roots that jutted from between the stones
of the path they followed. And it seemed that the voice of one unseen
cried, Lo! And the traveller looked up from out of the valley of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[524]</a></span>
journey, and, behold, a wan moon gleamed between the ravelled clouds;
and the face of his companion showed for that instant clear against
the sky in the shadow of its cloak. And it was the face of a nobleman;
renowned for his patience; courteous and cold; whose name is Death....</p>


<h4 id="note_68"><a href="#sn_68">68</a>. "<span class="smcap">London Bridge.</span>"</h4>

<p>This is yet another singing-game rhyme. When London was nothing but
a cluster of beehive huts in the hill clearings of the great Forest
of Middlesex above the marshes and the Thames, there can have been no
bridge. There <i>may</i> have been a bridge, it seems, in <span class="sm">A.D.</span> 44,
eighty-seven years after the death of Caesar; and for centuries there
was certainly a ferry, Audery the Shipwight being one of its ferrymen,
his oars the shape of shovels, and his boat like a young moon on her
back.</p>

<p>The rhyme appears to refer to the wooden bridge built in 994 at
Southwark, which was destroyed in 1008 by King Olaf, the Saint of
Norway, to whose glory four London churches are dedicated. Olaf had
become the ally of Ethelred (the Unready), and to defeat the Danes
who had captured the city he first screened his fighting ships with
frameworks of osier for the protection of his men, who then rowed them
up to the Bridge against the tide. They wapped and bound huge ropes
or hawsers round its timber piers, swept down with the slack with the
tide, and so brought the Bridge to ruin.</p>

<p>The first stone bridge, in building from 1196 to 1208, was partially
destroyed by fire four years afterwards. A picture of the entrancing
re-built Bridge of Elizabeth's time, with its chapel, its many-storied
gabled houses, its haberdashers', goldsmiths' and booksellers' shops,
its cut-waters or starlings and many narrow arches, its gate-house
with the spiked heads atop, its drawbridge and pillory, and that
strange timber mansion, with not a nail in its wood, called Nonesuch,
where perhaps lived the Lord Mayor&mdash;all this may be gloated over in
any old seventeenth-century map of London. (John Visscher's of 1616
shows a windmill in the Strand!) So narrow were those high arches, and
so vehemently flowed the tides beneath them, that even at ebb it was
dangerous for a novice to shoot them in a boat. But between Windsor and
Gravesend it is said there were forty thousand watermen and wherrymen
in Shakespeare's day, yelling "Eastward Ho!", or "West<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span>ward Ho!" for
passengers. The Bridge was the glory of London; as the Thames it
spanned was its main thoroughfare. Fire was its chief enemy; the Great
Fire in 1616 and that in 1633, after which it long continued to be used
though dark, dismal and dangerous. The present monster of granite, over
which the people of London stream to and fro throughout the day, like
ants at the flighting, was built thirty yards west of the old one and
began to span the river in 1832.</p>

Norfolk, January 2, 1682."</p>

<blockquote>

<p>And here is another from that inexhaustible Tom Tiddler's ground,
<i>Rustic Speech and Folklore</i> for the "funeral meats" of a farmer who
died near Whitby in 1760: "Besides what was distributed to 1,000 poor
people who had 6d. each in money, there was consumed</p>

</ul>

<p>For me the "great dish of tarts," the "guilded oranges" and "the
great charger of sweetmeats"! But after all, fine fat feasts such as
these are but a Town Mouse's crumb of Wedding Cake compared to Mac
Conglinnes' Vision in No. 73, which is from the Gaelic of 1100/1200
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, as translated by Kuno Meyer. <i>Bragget</i>, line 33, appears
to have been a concoction or decoction of ale, honey, sugar and spice,

made little girls.</p>

<p class="p-left">really <i>good</i> ale, that is, before beer was made "so mortal small," 133
years before tea-leaves came from China (to be boiled and the decoction
stored in a barrel); 140 before the first coffee-house in London; and
even, one might be tempted to add, before milk came from the cow, for
as late as 1512 the two young sons of the fifth earl of Northumberland,
Lord Percy aged eleven (who afterwards loved Anne Boleyn), and his
younger brother, Maister Thomas Percy, were allowed for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[527]</a></span> "braikfaste"

iii White Herrynge," and a <i>Potell of Bere</i>, <i>i.e.</i> two quarts or Eight
mugfuls.</p>

<p>"Hores," or heres, means <i>hairs</i>&mdash;cow's or dairymaid's. Butter is less
hairy nowadays, though on the other hand we have margarine.</p>

<p>I thought perhaps "Godes good" referred to a "podinge" for Saturdays&mdash;a

<h4 id="note_74"><a href="#sn_74">74</a>. "<span class="smcap">Pigeon Holes, Stool-ball, Barley-break.</span>"</h4>

<p>This fragment is a patchwork of the half-forgotten. "Pigeon holes"
was a ball-game, played on the green, with wooden arches and little
chambers as in a dovecot&mdash;a kind of open-air bagatelle. "Stool-ball"
was popular with Nancies and Franceses on Shrove Tuesday. Barley-break
was in Scotland a kind of "I spy," played in a stackyard, and in
England a sort of "French and English," in three marked spaces or
compartments, the middle one of which was called hell. And here&mdash;while
we are on the subject of old and gallant pastimes&mdash;is a brief
exposition of our noble and National Game of Cricket in its <i>early</i>
days. It comes from a book with the queer title, "A Nosegay for the
Trouble of Culling; or, Sports of Childhood":</p>

<p>"Cricket is a game universally played in England, not by boys only,
for men of all ranks pique themselves on playing it with skill.
In Mary-le-bone parish there is a celebrated cricket ground much
frequented by noblemen and gentlemen.</p>

<p>The wicket consists of two pieces of wood fixed upright and kept
together by another piece which is laid across the top and is called a
bail; if either of these pieces of wood be thrown down by the ball the
person so hitting them becomes the winner.</p>

<p>The ball used in this game is stuffed exceedingly hard. Many windows
and valuable looking-glasses have been broken by playing cricket in a
room."</p>

<p>It was in a cricket match in the summer of 1775, when no less than
three "balls" had rolled in between a Mr. Small's two stumps without
stirring the bail, that it was decided to add stump iii.</p>

<p>As for "tansy" (line 5), here is a recipe for it (to go with the
sillabub on p. 506): "Take 15 eggs, and 6 of the whites; beat them very
well; then put in some sugar, and a little sack; beat them again, and
put about a pint or a little more of cream; then beat them again; then
put in the juice of spinage or of primrose leaves to make it green.
Then put in some more sugar, if it be not sweet enough; then beat it
again a little, and so let it stand till you fry it, when the first
course is in. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[529]</a></span> fry it with a little sweet butter. It must be
stirred and fryed very tender. When it is fryed enough, then put it in
a dish, and strew some sugar upon it, and serve it in."</p>


<h4 id="note_75"><a href="#sn_75">75</a>. "<span class="smcap">Mary's gone a-milking.</span>"</h4>

<p>And, according to Sir Thomas Overbury (who dipped his pen in nectar as
well as ink), <i>"A Fair and Happy Milk-maid</i>," is "a country wench, that
is so far from making herself beautiful by art, that one look of hers
is able to put all facephysic out of countenance....</p>

<p>"She doth not, with lying long abed, spoil both her complexion and
conditions, ... she rises, therefore, with chanticleer, her dame's
cock, and at night makes the lamb her curfew. In milking a cow, and
straining the teats through her fingers, it seems that so sweet a
milk-press makes the milk the whiter or sweeter; for never came almond
glove or aromatic ointment on her palm to taint it. The golden ears of
corn fall and kiss her feet when she reaps them, as if they wish to be
bound and led prisoners by the same hand that felled them. Her breath
is her own which scents all the year long of June, like a new made
haycock. She makes her hand hard with labour, and her heart soft with
pity: and when winter evenings fall early (sitting at her merry wheel),
she sings a defiance to the giddy wheel of fortune. She doth all things
with so sweet a grace, it seems ignorance will not suffer her to do
ill, being her mind is to do well.... She dares go alone and unfold
sheep in the night, and fears no manner of ill, because she means none:
yet to say truth, she is never alone, for she is still accompanied with
old songs, honest thoughts, and prayers, but short ones....</p>

<p>"Thus lives she, and all her care is she may die in the springtime,
to have store of flowers stuck upon her winding-sheet."</p>


<h4 id="note_76"><a href="#sn_76">76</a>. "<span class="smcap">Cypresse black as ere was Crow.</span>"</h4>

<p>Cypresse (according to a memorandum from one of Mr. Nahum's books)
is the fine cobweblike stuff we now call crape. Peaking-stickes, or
poking-sticks, were gophering irons for frilling out linen, flounces,
etc., etc., and not, as one might guess, curling tongs (since a pointed
beard, and the V of hair on the forehead, used to be called peaks). A
quoife or coif is a lady's head-dress, such as is still worn by nuns;
while as for "maskes for faces," fine ladies in Shakespeare's day
customarily wore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[530]</a></span> them (as old pictures show) when they went to see his
plays. Masks were useful too in disguising the faces of his players,
when&mdash;as was the custom in the London theatres up to 1629&mdash;boys took
women's parts; and in the streets eyes gleamed out of the holes in
them, worn <i>then</i> for keeping the skin fair, untanned, and unfreckled,
as Julia says of herself in Shakespeare's <i>Two Gentlemen of Verona</i>:</p>

toothsome one; though I haven't yet been able to discover what he meant
by "hunting nuts":</p>

pond, and come home to eat a bit of roast chicken and peas at
about nine o'clock. Mama depends upon your bringing Tom over
to-morrow, and if you don't we shall be very much disappointed.</p>

<p>Tell the bearer not to forget to bring me a fairing&mdash;which is

Now I end.</p>

<p class="left8">I am <i>not</i>,</p>

<p class="left10">Your obedient servant,</p>

<p class="smcap r1">P. B. Shelley</p></blockquote>

<p>Even before Mr. Nahum's tower-room, I loved the "bonny brown hair"
of this poem. Was it squirrel brown, or chestnut, or hazelnut, or
autumn-beech, or heather-brown, or walnut, or old hay colour, or
undappled-fawn, or dark lichen, or velvet brown, or marigold or pansy

<p>This lament for matchless Robin Hood, who should shine in a far better
place than between "Beggars" and "Gilderoy," is the only rhyme about
him in this collection. The fact is, try as I might, I could not make
up my mind which I liked best of his old greenwood ballads in Mr.
Nahum's book. The oldest and best were all in formidable spelling, the
most of them were long, and maybe I was at last a little lazy. They are
all to be found in Professor Child. And if leaving out the merry outlaw
will persuade anyone to get and read <i>English and Scottish Ballads</i>, I
shall have omitted him to good purpose.</p>


<h4 id="note_87"><a href="#sn_87">87</a>. "<span class="smcap">Gilderoy.</span>"</h4>

<p>A pretty song about a monstrously ugly scoundrel, though handsome of
feature. Gilderoy was a highwayman, sparing for his prey neither man
nor woman, and if there were "roses" on his shoes, they were blood-red.
At last fifty armed avengers surrounded his house at night and set
on. He killed eight of them before he was captured; which, if true,
was bonnie fighting. Nevertheless, such a villain he was that he was
hanged,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[533]</a></span> without trial, on a gibbet thirty feet high, and the bones of
him (despite the last stanza of the ballad) dangled in chains forty
feet above Leith Walk in Edinburgh for fifty years afterwards.</p>

<p>In bounding health, it is said, a dog's nose and a woman's elbow are
always cold. The reason for which is explained in a legend (referred
to in Mrs. Wright's <i>Rustic Speech and Folk Lore</i>). It seems that in
the midst of its forty days' riding on the Flood, the Ark one black
night sprung a little leak. Father Noah having forgotten to bring
his carpenter's bag on board, was at his wits' end to plug the hole
in its timbers. In the beam of his rushlight he looked and he looked
and he looked; and still the water came rilling in and in. His dog,
Shafet, was of course standing by, head on one side, carefully watching
his master. And Noah, by good chance, at last casting his eye in his
direction, seized the faithful creature and, thrusting his nose into
the leak, for a while stopped the flow. But Noah, a merciful man,
and partial to animals, quickly perceived that in a few minutes poor
Shafet would perish of suffocation, and as, by this time, his wife
had descended into the fo'c'sle to see what he was about, he released
his dog's nose, and, instead of it, stuffed in her charming elbow.

<p>But not all dogs are as ready&mdash;as Launce in <i>The Two Gentlemen of

<p>"<i>Launce</i>: 'Nay, 'twill bee this howre ere I have done weeping. All

<p>Messalina's monkey was, I should fancy, of the kind called a marmoset,
"blacke and greene." "Their agilitie and manner of doing is admirable,
for that they seeme to have reason and discourse to go upon trees,
wherein they seeme to imitate birds." There are so few of these far
fair cousins of ours in poetry that I cannot forbear adding a note of
Mr. Nahum's from Sir John Maundeville's <i>Travels</i>.</p>

<p>" ... From that City, (that is to say Cassay&mdash;the City of Heaven), men
go by Water, solacing and disporting themselves, till they come to
an Abbey of Monks&mdash;that is fast by&mdash;that be good religious men after
their Faith and Law. In that Abbey is a great Garden and a fair, where
be many Trees of diverse manner of Fruits. And in this Garden, is a
little Hill, full of delectable Trees. In that Hill and in that Garden
be many divers Beasts, as of Apes, Marmosets, Baboons, and many other
divers Beasts. And every day, when the Monks of this Abbey have eaten,
the Almoner has the remnants carried forth into the Garden, and he
smiteth on the Garden Gate with a Clicket of Silver that he holdeth
in his hand, and anon all the Beasts of the Hill and of divers places
of the Garden, come out, a 3000 or a 4000 of them; they approach as
if they were poor men come a-begging; and the Almoner's servants give
them the remnants, in fair Vessels of Silver, clean over gilt. And when
they have eaten, the Monk smiteth eftsoons on the Garden Gate with the
Clicket; and then anon all the Beasts return again to their places that
they came from. And they say that these Beasts be Souls of worthy men,
that resemble in likeness the Beasts that be fair: and therefore they
give them meat for the love of God."</p>

<h4 id="note_93"><a href="#sn_93">93</a>. "<span class="smcap">Lo, the Bright Air Alive With Dragonflies.</span>"</h4>

<p>There is an old dialect children's rhyme about these lightlike
shimmering <i>stingless</i> insects:</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>Snakestanger, snakestanger, vlee aal about the brooks;</div>

        <div>While aal the littull bad bwoys shall only lick the dish.</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>And here is yet another rhyme on the <i>Firefly</i> (from Du Bartas), which
I have borrowed (with other passages as curious) from a mine of such
things, <i>Animal Lore of Shakespeare's Time</i>, by Miss Emma Phipson:</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>"New-Spain's <i>cucuio</i>, in his forehead brings</div>
        <div>Two burning lamps, two underneath his wings:</div>
        <div>Whose shining rayes serve oft, in darkest night,</div>
        <div>Th' imbroderer's hand in royall works to light:</div>
        <div>Th' ingenious turner, with a wakefull eye,</div>
        <div>To polish fair his purest ivory:</div>
        <div>The usurer to count his glistring treasures:</div>
        <div>The learned scribe to limn his golden measures."</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>"There is a kind of little animal of the size of prawnes," says
Champlain of these tiny winged things, "which fly by night, and make
such light in the air that one would say that they were so many little
candles. If a man had three or four of these little creatures, which
are not larger than a filbert, he could read as well at night as with a
wax light."</p>


<h4 id="note_95"><a href="#sn_95">95</a>. "<span class="smcap">The Sale of the Pet Lamb.</span>"</h4>

<p>"The Pet Lamb" by William Wordsworth is certainly of a more delicate
light and colour and music than this poem. But it is much better known.
And there is a secret something in the words of Mary Howitt's that wins
one at once to love the writer of it.</p>


<h4 id="note_98"><a href="#sn_98">98</a>.</h4>

<p>This is another translation by Kuno Meyer from the ancient Irish&mdash;just
the bare bones, that is, of a poem that in its original tongue must
have been many times more musical with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[537]</a></span> rhyme and gentle echo and
cadence; for the craft of Gaelic verse was an exceedingly delicate one.</p>

<p>I like it for the sake of its cat, its monk, and its age, but chiefly
because it reminds me of my own faraway days at Thrae&mdash;brooding up
there in solitude and silence over Mr. Nahum's books.</p>

<p>As for "white Pangur" and his kind, "it is needlesse," says Topsell,
"to spend any time about [Puss's] loving nature to man, how she
flattereth by rubbing her skinne against ones legges, how she whurleth
with her voyce, having as many tunes as turnes; for she hath one voice
to beg and to complain, another to testifie her delight and pleasure,
another among her own kind by flattring, by hissing, by spitting,
insomuch as some have thought that they have a peculiar intelligible
language among themselves." So also John de Trevisa, in 1387: "The
catte is a beaste of uncerten heare (hair) and colour; for some catte
is white, some rede, some blacke, some skewed (piebald) and speckled
in the fete and in the face and in the eares. He is a beste in youth,
swyfte, plyaunte, and mery, and lepeth and reseth (rusheth) on all
thynge that is tofore him; and is led by a strawe and playeth
therwith. He is a right hevy beast in aege, and ful slepy, and lyeth
slily in wait for myce. And he maketh a ruthefull noyse and gastfull,
whan one proffreth to fyghte with another, and he falleth on his owne
fete whan he falleth out of hye places."</p>

<p>The writings of the ancient Egyptians show that, far from detesting to
wet his paws, he would then <i>swim</i> in pursuit of fish. They painted
a cat for the sound "miaou" in their hieroglyphics; gazed into his
changing moon-like eyes and revered him; and embalmed him when dead.</p>

<p>Having borrowed him from Egypt, the Romans brought him to Britain
(though we already had a wilding of our own, <i>Felis Catus</i>'), with the
ass, the goat, the rabbit, the peacock, not to speak of the cherry, the
walnut, the crocus, the tulip, the leek, the cucumber, etc. The Monk's
Pangur, then, came of a long lineage.</p>

<p>So valuable were cats in <i>Wales</i> in the eleventh century (two or three
hundred years after Pangur), that their price was fixed by law: for
a blind kitten a penny; for a kitten with its eyes open, twopence;
for a cat of one mouse, fourpence, and so on. And to kill one of the
Prince's granary cats meant payment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[538]</a></span> of a fine of as much wheat as
would cover up its body when suspended by its tail. In Scotland there
has long been a complete Clan of Cats&mdash;apart from the witches. As for
the Cheshire Cat, he grins, I imagine, not because he has nine lives,
is said to be melancholy, may look at a king, and has nothing to do
with Catgut, Cat's cradle, and Cat-i'-the-pan, but because he has
read in a dictionary that Dick Whittington sailed off to the Isle of
Rats, not with a Cat, but with <i>acat</i> or <i>achat</i>, meaning goods for
trading&mdash;Coals! Long may he grin! How but one country Gib or Tom may
befriend the brightfaced Heartsease (so sturdy a little dear that it
will bloom at burning noonday in a gravel path) Charles Darwin tells in
his "<i>Origin of Species</i>," p. 57.</p>

<p>His "loving nature" to creatures <i>other</i> than man and the heartsease is
referred to in the following old Scots nursery rhyme:</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">

<p>The verb <i>dare</i> (I gather from Webster) was once used only in the past
tense, the preterite; for "dare he" therefore in this poem we should
now write <i>dared he</i>.</p>


<h4 id="note_100"><a href="#sn_100">100</a>.</h4>

<p>Andrew Marvell has three rare charms&mdash;his poetry is wholly his own; it
is as delightful as the sound of his name; and the face in his portrait
is as enchanting as either.</p>


<h4 id="note_101"><a href="#sn_101">101</a>-2.</h4>

<p>The Phillip of these two poems is, I suppose, the hedge-sparrow or
dunnock, that gentle and happy little cousin of the warblers&mdash;as light
and lovely in voice as they are on the wing. As everyone knows, a
bullfinch can be taught to whistle like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[539]</a></span> baker's boy, and will become
so jealous of his mistress that he will hiss and ruff with rage at
every stranger. Jackdaws and magpies, too, will become friends to a
friend. But a lady whom I have the happiness to know has a nightingale
that was hatched in captivity, and so has never shared either the
delights or the dangers of the wild. So easy is he in her company that
he will perch on her pen-tip as she sits at table, and sing as if out
of a garden in Damascus.</p>


<h4 id="note_102"><a href="#sn_102">102</a>. "<span class="smcap">He Would Chirp.</span>"</h4>

<p>" ... As she (St. Douceline) sat at meat, if anyone brought her a
flower, a bird, a fruit, or any other thing that gave her pleasure,
then she fell straightway into an ecstasy, and was caught up to Him Who
had made these fair creatures.... One day she heard a lonely sparrow
sing, whereupon she said to her companions, 'How lonely is the song of
that bird!' and in the twinkling of an eye she was in an ecstasy, drawn
up to God by the bird's voice...."</p>

<p>The above is from <i>A Medieval Garner</i>, and this, from a Note to "A
Saint's Tragedy," by Margaret L. Woods: When the blessed Elizabeth
"had been ill twelve days and more, one of her maids sitting by her
bed heard in her throat a very sweet sound, ... and saying, 'Oh, my
mistress, how sweetly thou didst sing!' she answered, 'I tell thee, I
heard a little bird between me and the wall sing merrily; who with his
sweet song so stirred me up that I could not but sing myself.'"</p>

<p>"They say," says Ophelia, "they say the owle was a Baker's daughter.
Lord, we know what we are, but know not what we may be. God be at your
Table." And thus runs the story:</p>

<p>Our Saviour being footsore, weary and hungry one darkening evening,
went into a baker's shop and asked for bread. The oven being then hot
and all prepared for the baking, the mistress of the shop cut off a
good-sized piece of the risen dough to bake for him. At this her fair,
greedy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[541]</a></span> daughter, who sate watching what was forward from a little
window, upbraided her mother for this wasting of profit on such an
outcast; and taking the platter out of her hands, she chopped the piece
of dough into half, and half, and half again. Nevertheless when this
mean small lump was put into the oven, it presently began miraculously
to rise and swell until it exceeded a full quartern of wheaten bread.
In alarm at this strange sight the daughter&mdash;her round blue eyes
largely eyeing the stranger in the dim light&mdash;turned on her mother, and
cried out: "O Mother, Mother, <i>Heugh, heugh, heugh</i>." "As thou hast
spoken," said our Saviour, "so be thou: child of the Night." Whereupon,
the poor creature, feathered and in the likeness of an owl, fled forth
into the dark towards the woodside.</p>

<h4 id="note_111"><a href="#sn_111">111</a>. "<span class="smcap">Her small Soul.</span>" (line 23)</h4>

<p><i>Smallest</i> of all shrill souls among the English birds is the wren, but
she has a remote relative that dwells in the dark and enormous forests
of South America, the Humming Bird, and simply for their own sakes I
cannot resist borrowing two more fragments from Miss Phipson's <i>Animal
Lore</i>. The first comes out of Purchas's <i>Pilgrimes</i>, and was written by
Antonia Galvano of New Spain:</p>

<p>"There be certaine small birds named <i>vicmalim</i>, their bil is small and
long. They live of the dew, and the juyce of flowers and roses. Their
feathers bee small and of divers colours. They be greatly esteemed
to worke gold with. They die or sleepe every yeere in the moneth of
October, sitting upon a little bough in a warme and close place: they
revive or wake againe in the moneth of April after that the flowers be
sprung, and therefore they call them the revived birds&mdash;<i>Vicmalim</i>."</p>

<p>The second is Gonzalo Ferdinando de Oviedo's&mdash;his very name a string of
gems:</p>

<p>" ... I have seene that one of these birds with her nest put into a
paire of gold weights [scales] altogether, hath waide no more then a
<i>tomini</i>, which are in poise 24 graines, with the feathers, without
the which she would have waied somewhat less. And doubtlesse, when I
consider the finenesse of the clawes and feete of these birds, I know
not whereunto I may better liken them then to the little birds which
the lymners of bookes are accustomed to paint on the margent of church
bookes, and other bookes of divine service. Their feathers are of manie
faire colours, as golden, yellow, and greene, beside other variable
colours. Their beake is verie long for the proportion of their bodies,
and as fine and subtile as a sowing needle. They are verie hardy, so
that when they see a man clime the tree where they have their nests,
they fly at his face, and strike him in the eyes, comming, going, and
returning with such swiftnesse, that no man should lightly beleeve it
that had not seene it...."</p>

<p>A wild and dreadful legend is hidden here&mdash;of a King who wronged his
Queen and her sister, daughters of Pandion, and how they avenged
themselves upon him, sacrificing his son to their hatred. That Queen,
goes this old tale, became a nightingale, her sister a swallow (crimson
still dying the feathers of her throat), the evil king a hoopoe, and
the firstborn was raised to life again a pheasant.</p>


<h4 id="note_115"><a href="#sn_115">115</a>. "<span class="smcap">A Sparhawk Proud</span>"</h4>

<p class="p-left">&mdash;a little bird but of a noble family. Listen, at least, to Auceps,
the Faulkner or Falconer, in "<i>The Compleat Angler</i>." [I have inserted
a few full stops in a sentence that has none] " ... And first, for
the Element that I use to trade in, which is the Air, an Element of
more worth than weight, an Element that doubtless exceeds both the
Earth and Water; for though I sometimes deal in both; yet the Air is
most properly mine, I and my Hawks use that most, and it yields us
most recreation. It stops not the high soaring of my noble generous
<i>Falcon</i>; in it she ascends to such an height, as the dull eyes of
beasts and fish are not able to reach to; their bodies are too gross
for such high elevations. In the Air my troops of Hawks soar up on
high, and when they are lost in the sight of men, then they attend upon
and converse with the gods, therefore I think my <i>Eagle</i> is so justly
styled, Joves servant in Ordinary. And that very Falcon, that I am now
going to see, deserves no meaner a title, for she usually in her flight
endangers her self, (like the son of <i>Daedalus</i>), to have her wings
scorched by the Suns heat, she flyes so near it. But her mettle makes
her careless of danger, for she then heeds nothing, but makes her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[544]</a></span>
nimble Pinions cut the fluid air, and so makes her high way over the
steepest mountains and deepest rivers, and in her glorious carere looks
with contempt upon those high Steeples and magnificent Palaces which
we adore and wonder at; from which height I can make her to descend by
a word from my mouth (which she both knows and obeys), to accept of
meat from my hand, to own me for her Master, to go home with me, and be
willing the next day to afford me the like recreation...."</p>

<p>When I was a child of eight or nine I had a kind of passion for
sparrows, and used to set traps for them; but even if I succeeded in
taking one alive, which was not always, I could never persuade it to
live in a cage above a day or two, however much I pampered it. It
drooped and died. Then, like a young crocodile, I occasionally shed
tears. One fine morning, I remember, I visited a distant trap and, as
usual, all but stopped breathing at discovering that it was "down."
Very cautiously edging in my fingers towards the captive, I was
startled out of my wits by a sudden prodigious skirring of wings, and
lo and behold, I had caught&mdash;and lost&mdash;a starling. He fled away twenty
yards or so, and perched on a hillock. I see him now, his feathers
glistening in the sun, and his sharp head turned towards me, his eyes
looking back at me, as if foe at foe. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[545]</a></span> that reminds me of the
Griffons&mdash;the guardians of the mines of the one-eyed Arimaspians.</p>

<p>" ... From that land go men toward the land of Bacharie, where be
full evil folk and full cruel.... In that country be many griffounes,
more plentiful than in any other country. Some men say that they have
the body upward as an eagle, and beneath as a lion; and truly they
say sooth that they be of that shape. But a griffoun hath the body
more great, and is more strong, than eight lions, of such lions as be
on this side of the world; and larger and stronger than an hundred
eagles, such as we have amongst us. For a griffoun there will bear
flying to his nest a great horse, if he may find him handy, or two
oxen yoked together, as they go at the plough. For he hath his talons
so long and so broad and great upon his feet, as though they were
homes of great oxen, or of bugles (bullocks), or of kine; so that men
make cups of them, to drink out of. And of their ribs, and the quills
of their wings, men make bows full strong, to shoot with arrows and
bow-bolts...."</p>

<p>But a griffoun is only a gigantic starling, so to speak; and it's a
pity mine and I were enemies. "If a sparrow come before my window,"
wrote John Keats in one of his letters, "I take part in its existence,
and pick about the gravel." Brick-traps are little help in this.</p>

<h4 id="note_126"><a href="#sn_126">126</a>. "<span class="smcap">Come unto these Yellow Sands.</span>"</h4>

<p>This poem and many others I copied out of Mr. Nahum's book in their
original spelling. At first I found the reading of some of them very
troublesome. It was like looking at a dried-up flower or beetle. But
there the things were; and after a good deal of trouble I not only
began to read them more easily, but grew to like them thus for their
own sake. First, because this was as they were actually written, before
our English printers agreed to spell alike; and next, because the old
words with their look of age became a pleasure to me in themselves. It
was like watching the dried-up flower or beetle actually and as if by a
magic of the mind coming to life. Besides, many of Shakespeare's small
poems were already known to me. It touched them with newness to see
them (though indeed <i>he</i> never so saw them), as they appeared (seven
years after his death), in the pages of the famous folio volume of his
<i>Plays</i> that was printed in 1623 by Isaac Jaggard and Edward Blount.</p>

<p>Not only that; for it is curious too to see how in the old days English
was constantly changing&mdash;its faded words falling like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[547]</a></span> dead leaves from
a tree, and new ones appearing. In a book which William Caxton printed
as far back even as 1490, he says: "And certainly our language now
used varieth far from that which was used and spoken when I was born.
For we Englishmen be born under the domination of the moon, which is
never steadfast but ever wavering, waxing one season and waneth and
decreaseth another season." So in our own day words, like human beings,
come into the world and pass away: and many gradually change their
meanings.</p>

<p>For if the spelling of a word alters its effect on the eye, it must
also affect the <i>mind</i> of the reader; and I must confess that "my
lovynge deare," looks to me to tell of somebody more lovable even than
"my loving dear." And what about shoogar-plummes, cleere greye eies,
the murrkie fogghe, the moones enravysshynge?</p>

<p>And what about&mdash;</p>

<p>Not that I have <i>always</i> kept to the old spellings. I have followed my
fancy; and if anyone would like to see an old poem in its first looks
that is here printed in our own way, all he need do is to go back to
the book in which it first appeared.</p>

<p>"Terrestrial devils," says Robert Burton, "are those Lares, Genii,
Fauns, Satyrs, Wood-nymphs, Foliots, Fairies, Robin Goodfellows,
Trulli, etc., which as they are most conversant with men, so they do
them most harm.... These are they that dance on heaths and greens ...
and leave that green circle, which we commonly find in plain fields,
which others hold to proceed from a meteor falling, or some accidental
rankness of the ground, so nature sports herself; they are sometimes
seen by old women and children.... Paracelsus reckons up many places
in Germany, where they do usually walk in little coats, some two
feet long. A bigger kind there is of them called with us hobgoblins,
and Robin Goodfellows, that would in those superstitious times grind
corn for a mess of milk, cut wood, or do any manner of drudgery work.
They would mend old irons in those Aeolian isles of Lipari, in former
ages, and have been often seen and heard.... Dithmarus Bleskenius,
in his description of Iceland, reports for a certainty, that almost
in every family they have yet some such familiar spirits.... Another
sort of these there are, which frequent forlorn houses.... They will
make strange noises in the night, howl sometimes pitifully, and then
laugh again, cause great flame and sudden lights, fling stones, rattle
chains, shave men, open doors and shut them, fling down platters,
stools, chests, sometimes appear in the likeness of hares, crows, black
dogs, etc." ...</p>

<p>In the small hours of Beltane or May Day, vast fires have been wont to
be kindled on the hills of the Highlands&mdash;a custom old as the Druids.
Mr. Gilbert Sheldon tells me that as lately as 1899 he saw the hills
round Glengariff ablaze with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[550]</a></span> them. They must be set aflame with what
is called need-fire. And need-fire is made by nine men twisting a
wimble of wood in a balk of oak until the friction makes sparks fly.
With these they ignite dry agaric, a fungus that grows on birch-trees,
and soon the blaze is reddening the countryside under the night-sky.
Need-fire in a window-nook or carried in a lantern is&mdash;like iron&mdash;an
invincible defence against witches and witchcraft. Beltane cakes&mdash;to
be eaten whilst squatting on the hills, or dancing and watching the
fire&mdash;are made out of a caudle of eggs, butter, oatmeal and milk.</p>

<h4 id="note_136"><a href="#sn_136">136</a>. "<span class="smcap">True Thomas.</span>"</h4>

<p>There are four copies in handwriting&mdash;two of them written about
1450&mdash;of a rhymed romance telling how Thomas in his youth, while
dreaming daydreams under the Eildon Tree, was met and greeted by the
Queen of fair Elfland. The ballad on p. 127 has been passed on from
mouth to mouth.</p>

<p>Up to our own grandmothers' day, at least, this Thomas Rhymour of
Ercildoune&mdash;a village nor far distant from where the Leader joins the
Tweed&mdash;was famous as a Wise One and a Seer (a See-er&mdash;with the inward
eye). He lived seven centuries ago, between 1210 and 1297. Years
after he had returned from Elfland&mdash;as the ballad tells&mdash;while he sat
feasting in his Castle, news was brought to him that a hart and a hind,
having issued out of the forest, were to be seen stepping fair and
softly down the stony street of the town, to the marvel of the people.
At this, Thomas at once rose from among his guests; left the table;
made down to the street; followed after these strange summoners: and
was seen again no more.</p>

<p>"Ilka tett," line 7, means every twist or plait; a "fairlie," stanza
II, is a wonder, mystery, marvel; and the "coat" in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[551]</a></span> the last stanza,
being of "even cloth," was finer than the finest <i>napless</i> damask.</p>

<p>So, too, Young Tamlane, when a boy "just turned of nine," was carried
off by the Elfin Queen:</p>

<h4 id="note_138"><a href="#sn_138">138</a>. "<span class="smcap">Sabrina.</span>"</h4>

<p>This song is from "Comus," a masque written by Milton for the
entertainment of the Earl of Bridgewater, lord lieutenant of Wales, at
Ludlow Castle in 1634. That Castle's Hall is now open to the sky&mdash;"the
lightning shines there; snow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[552]</a></span> burdens the ivy." From a neighbouring
room the two princes, Edward V. and his brother, went to their dark
death in the Tower. Below the ruinous Castle flow together the Terne
and the Corve, on their way to the great Severn&mdash;of which Sabrina, the
daughter of Estrildis, is the Nymph, she having been drowned in its
waters by Guendolen, the jealous queen of Locrine the son of Brut.
Estrildis herself, the daughter of King Humber, "so farre excelled in
bewtie, that none was then lightly found unto her comparable, for her
skin was so whyte that scarcely the fynest kind of Ivorie that might
be found, nor the snowe lately fallen downe from the Elament, nor the
Lylles did passe the same."</p>

<p>Milton's poems&mdash;<i>Lycidas</i>, for instance&mdash;frequently resemble bunches of
keys, each one of them fitting the lock of some ancient myth or legend.
In the lines I have omitted from No. 138 are many such locks awaiting
the reader&mdash;a reference to the following tale of Glaucus, for example:</p>

<p>There is a secret herb which, if nibbled by fish already gasping
to death in our air, gives them the power and cunning to slip back
through the grasses into their waters again. Of this herb Glaucus
tasted, and instantly his eyes dazzled in desire to share their green
transparent deeps. Whereupon the laughing divinities of the rivers gave
him sea-green hair, sleeking the stream, fins and a fish's tail, and
feasted him merrily. His story is told by Keats in the third book of
his <i>Endymion</i>, while Leucothea's, another reference, is to be found
in the fifth of the <i>Odyssey</i>. As for the Sirens, here is the counsel
Circe gave Ulysses, the while his seamen lay asleep the night after
they had returned in safety from Pluto's dismal mansions:</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">

        <div>Hung all along upon it; and these men</div>
        <div>Were such as they had fawned into their fen,</div>
        <div>And then their skins hung on their hedge of bones.</div>
        <div>Sail by them therefore, thy companions</div>
        <div>Beforehand causing to stop every ear</div>

that a poet of the name of Gray won the esteem of Henry VIII. and the
Duke of Somerset for "making certeine merry ballades, whereof one
chiefly was, 'the hunte is up, the hunte is up." Henry VIII., moreover,
was himself a versifier, and a musician, though, as I have read, a dull
one. Here is the first stanza of one of his poems:</p>

<p>Thomas Campion was "borne upon Ash Weddensday being the twelft day of
February. An. Rg. Eliz. nono"&mdash;1567. He had one sister, Rose. He was
educated at Peterhouse, Cambridge, and this was his yearly allowance
of clothes: A gowne, a cap, a hat, ii dubletes, ii payres of hose,
iiii payres of netherstockes, vi payre of shoes, ii shirts, and two
bandes. He was allowed also one quire of paper every quarter; and half
a pound of candles every fortnight from Michaelmas to Lady Day. He
studied law, may for a time have fought as a soldier in France, and
became a physician. He died on March 1, 1620, and was buried on the
same day at St. Dunstan's in the West, Fleet Street, the entry in the
register under that date being: "Thomas Campion, doctor of Phisicke,
was buried."</p>

<p>I have taken these particulars from Mr. S. P. Vivian's edition of
his poems, because it is pleasant to share even this little of what
is known of a man who is not only a rare and true poet&mdash;though for
two centuries a forgotten one&mdash;but also because he was one of the
chief song-writers in the great age of English Music. Like all
good craftsmen, he did his work "well, surely, cleanly, workmanly,
substantially, curiously, and sufficiently," as did the glaziers of
King's College Chapel, which is distant but a kingfisher's flight over
a strip of lovely water from his own serene Peterhouse. It seems a
little curious that being himself a lover of music he should have at
first disliked rhymes in verse, though he lived to write such delicate
rhymed poems as this.</p>

<p>In the preface to his <i>Book of Ayres</i>, he tells the secret of his
craft: "In these English Ayres," he says, "I have chiefely aymed to
couple my Words and Notes <i>lovingly</i> together, which will be much for
him to doe that hath not power over both."</p>


<h4 id="note_160"><a href="#sn_160">160</a>. "<span class="smcap">What is there hid in the Heart of a Rose?</span>"</h4>

<p>There is a legend in <i>Sir John Mandeville's Travels</i>, which in our
spelling runs thus: "Bethlehem is a little city, long and narrow and
well walled, and on each side enclosed with good ditches. It was wont
to be called Ephrata.... And toward the east end of the city is a full
fair church and a gracious, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[562]</a></span> it hath many towers, pinnacles, and
corners, full strong, and curiously made; and within that church be
forty-four pillars of marble, massive and fair.</p>

<p>"And between the city and the church is the field <i>Floridus</i>, that is
to say, the 'Field of Flowers'; it being so named for this reason: A
fair maiden was blamed with wrong and slandered ... for which cause she
was demned to death and to be burnt in that place, to the which she was
led. And, as the fire began to crackle about her, she made her prayers
to our Lord,&mdash;that, as assuredly as she was not guilty of that sin,
He would help her and make it to be known to all men, of His merciful
grace. And when she had thus said, she entered into the fire, and anon
was the fire quenched and out; and the brands that were burning became
red rose-trees, and the brands that were not kindled became white
rose-trees, full of roses. And these were the first rose-trees and
roses, both white and red, that ever any man saw; and thus was this
maiden saved by the grace of God. And therefore is that field clept the
field of God, <i>Floridus</i>, for it is full of roses."</p>

<h4>"<span class="smcap">The Phoenix builds her Spicy Nest.</span>" (line 18)</h4>

<p>The Phoenix, in faith rather than by sight, is thus described by
Pliny: "She is as big as an eagle, in colour yellow, and bright as
gold, namely all about the neck, the rest of the bodie a deepe red
purple; the taile azure blue, intermingled with feathers among of
rose carnation colour: and the head bravely adorned with a crest and
pennache finely wrought, having a tuft and plume thereupon right faire
and goodly to be seene."</p>

<p>Her life is but three hundred and nine years less in duration than
that of the many-centuried patriarch Methuselah. When the lassitude
of age begins to creep upon her, she wings across sea and land to the
sole Arabian Tree. There she builds a nest of aromatic twigs, cassia
and frankincense, and enkindling it with her own dying ardour she is
consumed to ashes. And yet&mdash;while still they are of a heat beyond the
tempering of the sun that shines down on them from the heavens, they
magically stir, take body and awaken; and she rearises to life renewed,
in her gold, her rose carnation, her purple and azure blue.</p>

<h4 id="note_164"><a href="#sn_164">164</a>. "<span class="smcap">The Bower of Bliss.</span>"</h4>

<p>This and No. 348 are but the merest fragments of the <i>Faerie Queene</i>;
but they show of what an echoing mutable music are its words. And
were ever light and colour so living, natural and crystal clear?
Reading this verse, hearing its sounds and seeing its sights in the
imagination, you cannot think Thomas Nash was too fantastical when he
wrote: "Poetry is the Honey of all Flowers, the Quintessence of all
Sciences, the Marrow of Art and the very Phrase of Angels." Indeed, as
Spenser's epitaph in Westminster Abbey says of him, he was the Prince
of Poets of his time, whose divine spirit needs no other witness than
the works which he left behind him. And poet of poets he has always
remained. John Keats, when he was a boy, used to sit in a little
summerhouse at Enfield with his schoolfellow Cowden Clarke, simply
drinking in this verse, and laying up store of purest English for his
own brief life's matchless work. So, too, Abraham Cowley:</p>

<p>"How this love (for poetry) came to be produced in me so early is a
hard question. I believe I can tell the particular little chance that
filled my head first with such chimes of verse as have never since left
ringing there. For I remember when I began to read, and to take some
pleasure in it, there was wont to lie in my mother's parlour (I know
not by what accident, for she herself never in her life read any book
but of devotion), but there was wont to lie Spenser's works; this I
happened to fall upon, and was infinitely delighted with the stories
of the knights and giants and monsters and brave houses which I found
everywhere there (though my understanding had little to do with all
this); and by degrees with the tinkling of the rhyme and dance of the
numbers, so that I think I had read him all over before I was twelve
years old...."</p>


<h4 id="note_170"><a href="#sn_170">170</a>.</h4>

<p>The poems of Robert Herrick and of Thomas Campion though known well in
their own day remained for many years practically unread and forgotten.
Thomas Traherne's (who died in 1674) had an even more curious fate,
for they were discovered in manuscript and by chance on a bookstall so
lately as 1896, and were first taken to be the work of Henry Vaughan.
Here is a passage in prose from <i>Centuries of Meditation</i>, by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[565]</a></span> same
writer, repeating this reverie of his childhood in other words: "The
corn was orient and immortal wheat which never should be reaped nor
was ever sown. I thought it had stood from everlasting to everlasting.
The dust and stones of the street were as precious as gold; the gates
were at first the end of the world. The green trees when I saw them
first through one of the gates transported and ravished me; their
sweetness and unusual beauty made my heart to leap, and almost mad
with ecstasy, they were such strange and wonderful things. The men!
oh, what venerable and reverend creatures did the aged seem! Immortal
cherubims! And young men glittering and sparkling angels! and maids
strange seraphic pieces of life and beauty! Boys and girls tumbling in
the street were moving jewels: I knew not that they were born or should
die. But all things abided eternally as they were in their proper
places. Eternity was manifest in the light of the day, and something
infinite behind everything appeared, which talked with my expectation
and moved my desire...."</p>


<h4 id="note_172"><a href="#sn_172">172</a>. "<span class="smcap">But silly we.</span>" (line 9)</h4>

<p>This poem, I think carries with it the thought that in study of that
great book, that fair volume, called the World, there is no full
stop, no limit, pause, conclusion. Like bees, with their nectar and
honeycomb, man stores up his knowledge and experience in books. These
and his houses outlast him; the things he makes; and here and there a
famous or happy or tragic name is for a while remembered. Else, we have
our Spring and Summer&mdash;and dark cold skies enough, many of us&mdash;then
vanish away, seeming but restless phantoms in Time's enormous dream. So
far at least as this world is concerned. And generations of men&mdash;as of
the grasses and flowers&mdash;follow one upon the other.</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">

        <div class="i1">Is duller than a witling's jest.</div>
        <div>Love wakes men, once a life-time each;</div>
        <div class="i1">They lift their heavy lids, and look;</div>
        <div>And, lo, what one sweet page can teach</div>
        <div class="i1">They read with joy, then shut the book:</div>
        <div>And some give thanks, and some blaspheme,</div>
        <div class="i1">And most forget; but, either way,</div>
        <div>That and the Child's unheeded dream</div>
        <div class="i1">Is all the light of all their day.</div>

<p>The writer of this magnificent Battle-Hymn died in 1910, at the age
of ninety-one. If Henry Carey, who wrote our own "National Anthem,"
had realised how much and how often <i>his</i> fellow countrymen were to
be fated to use his words, he would perhaps have taken a little more
trouble with them (as much, at any rate, as Shelley and Flecker took
in <i>their</i> versions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[568]</a></span> of it), and would have found a pleasanter rhyme
than "over us" for "glorious," and than "voice" for "cause." If, on the
other hand, he had read the following <i>Grace</i> which Ben Jonson made at
the moment's call before King James, he might perhaps have refrained
from rhyming altogether, and so, by sheer modesty, would have missed
being immortalized:</p>

<p>"To those," it is said, "who have resided a long time by the falls
of Niagara, the lowest whisper is distinctly audible." Their hearing
accustoms itself to that unending and enormous roar, and becomes more
exquisite. This is untrue of those whose finer sense is lulled by the
roar of war: they become deafened, and cannot hear the voice of the one
soldier&mdash;of which human "ones" every army is composed. And so war may
poison even when its intention and its cause are honour and faith. In
this particular poem (No. 177), the soldier is one of those who fought
in the Transvaal in the years 1899-1901.</p>

<p>Rupert Brooke, Wilfred Owen, Edward Thomas, Julian Grenfell, Charles
Sorley, Francis Ledwidge, Alan Seeger, Joyce Kilmer&mdash;these are the
names of but a few of the men, none of them old, many of them in the
heyday of their gifts and genius, who besides proving themselves
soldiers in the Great War had also proved themselves poets. Within his
powers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[569]</a></span> every true poet lives in his country's service. These in that
service died.</p>

<p>" ... Old stairs wind upwards to a long corridor, the distant ends of
which are unseen. A few candles gutter in the draughts. The shadows
leap. The place is so still that I can hear the antique timbers
talking. But something is without which is not the noise of the wind. I
listen, and hear it again, the darkness throbbing; the badly adjusted
horizon of outer night thudding on the earth&mdash;the incessant guns of the
great war.</p>

<p>And I come, for this night at least, to my room. On the wall is a tiny
silver Christ on a crucifix; and above that the portrait of a child,
who fixes me in the surprise of innocence, questioning and loveable,
the very look of warm April and timid but confiding light. I sleep with
the knowledge of that over me, an assurance greater than that of all
the guns of all the hosts. It is a promise. I may wake to the earth I
used to know in the morning."</p>

<p>The reader may speculate how it is that while room has been found here
for this entrancing rhyme, none has been made for Macaulay's longer
Lays, Browning's Cavalier Songs, and a host of poems equally gallant
and spirited. Perhaps he will forgive their absence if he will consider
what is said on page xxxiii, and if he will also remember that every
chooser must make his choice.</p>

<p>There is, too, the story of the Woodcutter's son. This fuzzheaded
boy, called Dick or Dickon, while playing on his elder pipe the
tune of "Over the Hills" one dappled sunshine morning in the woods,
fortuning to squinny his eye sidelong over his pipe, perceived a
crooked and dwarf old man to be standing beside him where before was
only a solitary bearded thistle. This old man, the twist of whose
countenance showed him to be one with an ear for woodland music,
invited the Woodcutter's son to descend with him into the orchards
of the Gnomes&mdash;and to help himself. This he did, and marvellously he
fared. On turning out his pockets that night&mdash;the next day being a
Sunday&mdash;his Mother found (apart from the wondrous smouldering heap of
fruits, amethyst, emerald, rubies and the topaz, which he had given
her) two or three strange unpolished stones, and these also from the
Old Man's orchards.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[570]</a></span> And she climbed up with her candle, he being abed,
and asked him why he had burdened himself with such things of little
seeming value, when he might have carried off their weight in diamonds
big as dumplings. "Well, you see, mother dear," he drowsily replied, "I
chose of the best and brightest till my eyes dazzled; and then there
was a bird that called, Dick! Dick! Dick! Dick! and those magic pebbles
were among her eggs."</p>

<p class="p-left">&mdash;from <i>The Dynasts</i>, Act V., Scene VII., Part i. Boatmen and burghers
with their pipes and mugs are sitting on settles round the fire in
the taproom of the <i>Old Rooms</i> Inn at Weymouth. The body of Nelson on
board his battered <i>Victory</i> has lately been brought to England to be
sepulchred in St. Paul's. And this is the Song the Second Boatman sings.</p>

<p>The "Nothe," line 8, is the promontory that divides for Weymouth, where
lived Nelson's Captain Hardy, its harbour or back-sea on the north,
and the Portland Roads, its front-sea on the south "Roads," meaning
protected seas where ships may <i>ride</i> at anchor. On this tempestuous
and fateful night, October 21, 1805, the breakers were sweeping clean
across the spit of land called the Narrows. On the further side runs
for a round ten miles that enormous wall of pebbles&mdash;Chesil Beach,
whose stones the tides sort out so precisely&mdash;the least in size towards
Lyme Regis&mdash;that a coast-man can tell even in a thick mist where he
has landed on the beach, merely by measuring them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[571]</a></span> with his eye. About
ten miles up this water swim in Spring the swans of the Swannery of
Abbotsbury with their cygnets, each mother-bird striving to decoy as
many strange young ones into her train as she can. So deals a proud and
powerful nation with the lesser kingdoms of the earth.</p>

<p>About four years and a half before Trafalgar, on April 2nd, 1801,
Nelson and Parker had won the Battle of the Baltic&mdash;as Thomas Campbell
(who was then twenty-four), in his well-known poem tells:</p>

tells her is as old as Romance. Once get cantering, too; how pleasing

<p>From his childhood, which was spent in a little shop in Dublin, Mangan
had a dark and troubled life. But always a passionate love for his
country, Ireland&mdash;his Dark Rosaleen&mdash;burned on in his imagination as it
is revealed in the wild and haunting music of this poem.</p>

<p>There are so many words in this poem strange to an English ear that it
seems better to explain them here so as not to interrupt the actual
reading of it too much. After all, the little that is not plain speaks
in its music, and that is a very large part of what we call its
"meaning." For the meaning of a poem is <i>all</i> the interest, thought,
pictures, music, and happiness that we can get out of it&mdash;it is all
that it <i>does</i> to us.</p>

<p>Stanza (1) "loaning" is a green path in the fields, and "ilka" means
every; "wede" means faded or vanished. (2) "bught" is a sheepfold;
"scorning" I suppose means cracking jokes at one another; "dowie" means
sad and drooping; "daffing" and "gabbing" is larking and gossiping;
a "leglin" is a milkpail. (3) "hairst" means harvest; "bandsters,
"sheaf-binders"; "lyart" is faded with age; "runkled" wrinkled;
"fleeching" is wheedling or coaxing or flirting. (4) "swankies" means
the blithe lads of stanza 2; "bogle" means goblin or bogey&mdash;an evening
game like "I spy," I should think. (5) "Dool and wae" means sorrow or
grief and woe.</p>

<p>Robert Hayman, a Merchant of Bristol at the age of twenty-five, was
a nephew of Sir Walter Raleigh's. He became Governor of a Plantation
called <i>The British Hope</i> in Newfoundland. In 1628 he settled in Guiana
(of whose gilded and barbaric Amazonian princesses his uncle tells in
Hakluyt's <i>Voyages</i>). He made his will in 1633, and nothing more was
afterwards heard of him&mdash;at least by the people of Bristol.</p>

<p>Poetry shines out of his stumbling verses like the setting sun through
a thicket of thorns. Their "Totnes" is an uncommonly old town, mainly
consisting of that "long street" where, when a boy, he met "godly
Drake." At its East-Gate is the Brutus-stone&mdash;for here Brut of Troy
is said first to have trodden English soil, having landed from the
Dart. Twenty miles distant to westward of the town lies on its rivers
Plymouth&mdash;the Spaniards' wasps' nest&mdash;its Drake in stone now gazing out
to sea from its Hoe. Twenty miles to the east on the coast is Hayes
Barton, where Raleigh was born about 1552. And seven miles down the
Dart is the village of Green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[574]</a></span>way, the home of his half-brother Sir
Humphrey Gilbert, the discoverer of Newfoundland, who was in that year
a boy of about sixteen. Here amid-stream juts up the Anchor Rock upon
which, runs the story, the discoverer of tobacco and of the potato used
to sit and smoke his pipe. In 1587 Gilbert and Raleigh sailed together
in search of the as yet Unfoundland, but on that voyage in vain.</p>

<p>Hally was Henry, Prince of Wales, the eldest son of James I., Queen
Elizabeth's godson, and a beloved patron of the arts and poetry to whom
Sir Walter Raleigh looked for happy favours. He was little of body and
quick of spirit, and, like Alexander, delighted "to witch the World
with noble horsemanship." He died when he was nineteen. In Windsor
Castle may be seen a suit of armour made for this young prince when he
was a boy&mdash;a suit which for grace and craftsmanship is said to be one
of the most beautiful things of its kind in the world.</p>

<p>This is the translation of another ancient Irish poem made by Kuno
Meyer. Plutarch wrote Alexander's Life (comparing him with Julius
Caesar), in which the young prince is pictured as if by Velasquez. Here
are a few words from the translation of this life which Sir Thomas
North made from the French of Amiot:</p>

<p>"The ambition and desire he (Alexander) had of honour showed a certain
greatness of mind and noble courage, passing his years.... For when
he was asked one day (because he was swift of foot) whether he would
assay to run for victory at the Olympian Games, 'I could be content'
(said he), 'so I might run with Kings'." When, too, "they brought him
news that his Father had taken some famous city, or had won<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[575]</a></span> some
great battle, he was nothing glad to hear it, but would say to his
playfellows: 'Sirs, my Father will have all: I shall have nothing left
me to conquer with you that shall be ought worth' ..."</p>

three Eagles whose eyes surveyed the kingdoms of the world, its seas
and Man's lost possessions. And the Eagle that was eastwards of the
three, a little rimpled her wings and cried: "Where now? where now?"
And the Eagle that shook upon her plumes the dazzle of the dying sun
stretched out her corded neck and yelped: "Man! Man!" And the midmost
Eagle stooped low its golden head and champed between its talons with
its beak upon the boulder: "The Earth founders," she mewed. And a
stillness was upon the hill as though of a myriad watching eyes.</p>

<p>Scattered through this volume are many songs, a few of them&mdash;both
words and music&mdash;exceedingly ancient. Mr. Nahum had a cofferful of
old hand-written music (square crotchets and quavers and handsome
clefs); and many outlandish instruments were hung up in the dust and
silence in one of his cupboards. I remember some small living thing
set a string jangling when for the first time the door admitted me to
a sight of their queer shapes and appearances. In an old book of 1548,
<i>The Complaynt of Scotland</i>, there is a list of names, not only of old
folk-tales such as "The tayl of the wolfe of the varldes end"; and "The
tayl of the giantes that eit quyk men," but of songs and dances for

<p>And here some Dances:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All Christian Men's Dance.</li>
  <li>Long Flat Foot of Garioch.</li>
  <li>The Lamb's Wind.</li>
  <li>Leaves Green.</li>
  <li>The Bace of Voragon.</li>
  <li>The Loch of Slene.</li>
  <li>The Bee.</li>
  <li>Shake a Trot, and</li>
  <li>The Vod and the Val.</li>
</ul>

<p>The tunes to these were played at that day on four kinds of bagpipe
(including a drone bagpipe), a trump, a recorder, a "fiddell," and a
"quhissil"&mdash;which is the pleasantest way of spelling <i>whistle</i> I have
yet seen. The melodies and words of most of them are, apparently, all
now clean forgotten.</p>

<p>"Fa la la" (No. 210) is of a different kind, being one of hundreds
of madrigals, "ayres" and ballets of which both the words and the
music were written in England in the first twenty years or so of the
seventeenth century. There is, of course, a hoard of learning that one
may study on this English music&mdash;William Byrd's, John Dowland's, Thomas
Ford's, Thomas Campion's, John Bartlet's, Philip Rosseter's, Robert
Ayres' and others&mdash;which in its own day was as famous in the countries
of Europe as English poetry is now. It was the coming of foreign music
and musicians to England&mdash;the Italians and Handel and Mendelssohn&mdash;that
put it ungratefully out of mind. To-day its dust has at last been
brushed away. The Madrigals are being printed and sung again, and Dr.
Fellowes has lately published a volume containing the words of hundreds
of such lively, nimble and heart-entrancing rhymes&mdash;intended by their
writers to carry with them a double charm&mdash;not only their own verbal
melody, grace and beauty, but also their music's.</p>

<p>My own knowledge is scanty indeed, but I gather that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[578]</a></span> madrigal
is intended to be sung, unaccompanied with instruments, by voices
only&mdash;three to five, six, or seven, it may be, and men's and women's or
boys', coursing, echoing, interweaving, responding and rilling together
like the countless runnels and wavelets of a brook over its stones, or
a wood full of singing birds at evening. An Ayre is different. It is
for the voice&mdash;singing its melody to the accompaniment of lute, viol
or virginal, as a nightingale may sing at dusk above the murmur of a
softly-brawling brook. A Ballet, the most ancient of all three, went
hand in hand and foot to foot with a dance.</p>

<p>All I wish to make clear is that the printed words of Nos. 210 and
212, for instance, can give only a fraction of the pleasure their
poets intended, who in writing had always the singing voice and often
the twangling string in mind. Their very age to my fancy gives them
an enticing strangeness, grace, and freshness. For in their company
the imagination returns to the days when first they rang out in the
taverns and parlours and palaces and streets of a London that from
every steeple and tower was within sight of green fields; a noble city
of but about three hundred thousand people (including children) wherein
you might any day find William Shakespeare, Ben Johnson, Chapman and
the rest talking together in its taverns, the <i>Mermaid</i> or the <i>Triple
Tun</i>, while that ill-fortuned traveller and statesman, Sir Walter
Raleigh, fallen upon evil days, sat mewed up in the Tower of London,
engrossed in his <i>History of the World</i>.</p>

<p>None the less there are human beings who remain deaf to the magic both
of words and music&mdash;that, like the deaf adder, <i>stop</i> their ears: "I
know very well," wrote Sir William Temple, "that many who pretend to
be wise by the forms of being grave, are apt to despise both poetry
and music as toys and trifles too light for the use or entertainment
of serious men. But whoever find themselves wholly insensible to these
charms, would I think do well to keep their own counsel, for ...
while this world lasts, I doubt most but the pleasure and requests of
these two entertainments will do so too; and happy those that content
themselves with these, or any other so easy and so innocent; and do
not trouble the world or other men, because they cannot be quiet
themselves, though nobody hurts them!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[579]</a></span></p>

<p>"When all is done, human life is at the greatest and the best but like
a froward child, that must be played with and humoured a little to keep
it quiet till it falls asleep, and then the care is over."</p>

<p>June 24 is not only the birthday of St. John the Baptist, but also the
year's Sun Day, for about this day, following through the night but
a little way beneath the horizon, he rises at dawn furthest North of
East in his annual journey (see p. xiv). As once on May-day so it was
then formerly the custom, all England over, to set bonfires blazing
on the hilltops, around which the country people danced and sang. The
dairy-maid who had the breath, and was fleet enough of foot to ring
around, between dusk and daybreak, nine such merry bonfires before they
were burnt out, assured her heart of a happy marriage within the year.</p>

<h4 id="note_225"><a href="#sn_225">225</a>.</h4>

<p>This "Country Rhime," with Nos. 121 and 434, is taken from <i>A Book
for Boys and Girls</i>, written by John Bunyan. It came out into the
world on May 12th, 1686, two years before Bunyan died on Snow Hill in
London; and two years after the publication of the Second Part of <i>The
Pilgrim's Progress</i>, "wherein is set forth the manner of the setting
out of Christian's Wife and Children, their dangerous journey, and safe
arrival at the Desired Country."</p>

<p>When Bunyan was young he loved ringing the bells with the ringers in
the steeple of the village church of Elstow, where he was born, and
where his grandfather, Thomas Bonyon, was "a common baker of human
bread."</p>

<p>All these "Homely rhimes" are followed in this particular <i>Book for
Boys and Girls</i> by comparisons", as here: first the bells; then a
lesson about them. They are parables. But in Mr. Nahum's copying, many
of the lessons were omitted;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[583]</a></span> perhaps because he preferred to think
out his own. Not that the poetry that is intended to teach, to praise
virtue, and to instil wisdom in the heart and mind of its readers is
any the less poetry for this reason. Nevertheless, <i>every</i> beautiful
thing in this world&mdash;the hyssop in the wall and the cedar of Lebanon,
Solomon in all his glory and the ring on his finger, carries with it
joy and wonder of the life that is ours, and gratitude to the Maker of
all. And poets who, when writing, are too intent upon teaching, are apt
to forfeit their rarest poetry.</p>


<h4 id="note_232"><a href="#sn_232">232</a>.</h4>

<p>Dorothy was William Wordsworth's only sister and his friend Coleridge's
close friend. What she squandered on these two poets&mdash;her self, her
talk, her imagination, her love&mdash;only they could tell. "She gave
me eyes, she gave me ears," once wrote her brother; she shared his
visionary happiness. With Coleridge she used to walk and talk so nearly
and dearly that again and again in her <i>Journal</i> she uses all but the
very words&mdash;that "thin gray cloud," the line on Spring, or on the one
red leaf, for instance&mdash;which are so magically his own in <i>Christabel</i>
(No. 345).</p>


<h4 id="note_233"><a href="#sn_233">233</a>. "<span class="smcap">To Autumn.</span>"</h4>

<p>I read this&mdash;perhaps the loveliest of John Keats's odes, many times
before I realised that the whole of it is addressed to the musing
apparition or phantasm of Autumn whom in its second stanza he describes
as if she were in image there before him. This, perhaps, was partly
because the poem is usually printed with a full stop after "clammy
cells," and partly because of my own stupidity.</p>

<p>Thomas Hood, in his scarcely less beautiful Ode, sees Autumn first as
an old man:</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>I saw old Autumn in the misty morn</div>
        <div>Stand shadowless like Silence, listening</div>
        <div>To silence, for no lonely bird would sing</div>
        <div>Into his hollow ear from woods forlorn,</div>
        <div>Nor lowly hedge nor solitary thorn;</div>
        <div>Shaking his languid locks all dewy bright</div>
        <div>With tangled gossamer that fell by night,</div>
        <div class="i2">Pearling his coronet of golden corn.</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[584]</a></span></p>

<p>And later, in his fourth stanza:</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>The squirrel gloats on his accomplished hoard,</div>

        <div>The sweets of Summer in their luscious cells;</div>
        <div>The swallows all have winged across the main;</div>

        <div class="i3">Alone, alone,</div>

        <div>She sits and reckons up the dead and gone,</div>
        <div>With the last leaves for a love-rosary,</div>
        <div>Whilst all the withered world looks drearily,</div>
        <div>Like a dim picture of the drownèd past</div>
        <div>In the hushed mind's mysterious far away,</div>
        <div>Doubtful what ghostly thing will steal the last</div>
        <div>Into that distance, gray upon the gray....</div>

<p>"Far to fetch" it certainly is; but here is a little counsel to this
end from the old Irish <i>Instructions of King Cormac</i> (of the ninth
century). Of Carbery I know no more, but doubtless there is much to
hear:</p>

<p>"O Cormac, grandson of Conn," said Carbery, "what is the worst for the
body of man?"</p>

<p>"Not hard to tell," said Cormac. "Sitting too long, lying too long,
long standing, lifting heavy things, exerting oneself beyond one's
strength, running too much, leaping too much, frequent falls, sleeping
with one's leg over the bed-rail, gazing at glowing embers, wax,
biestings [very new milk], new ale,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[585]</a></span> bull-flesh, curdles, dry food,
bog-water, rising too early, cold, sun, hunger, drinking too much,
eating too much, sleeping too much, sinning too much, grief, running
up a height, shouting against the wind, drying oneself by a fire,
summer-dew, winter-dew, beating ashes, swimming on a full stomach,
sleeping on one's back, foolish romping." ...</p>

<p>"O Cormac, grandson of Conn," said Carbery, "I desire to know how
I shall behave among the wise and the foolish, among friends and
strangers, among the old and the young, among the innocent and the
wicked."</p>

<p>"Not hard to tell," said Cormac.</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">

<p>There may be a few small verbal puzzles in this fifteenth-century
carol&mdash;otherwise as clear, sharp and shining as a winter moon.</p>

<p><i>Kechoun</i> is kitchen, and Stephen (who waited on the King at bed and
board) stepped out of it into the hall, "boar's head on hand." <i>Kyst</i>,
means cast; <i>eylet</i>, aileth; <i>wod</i> is mad. So too <i>brede</i>, I fancy.
When the roasted capon or cock crowed in its dish, Herod, in wrath and
fear cried on his torturers, "by two and all by one" to rise up and
kill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">[588]</a></span></p>

<p>In later times a clay or earthenware box made all of a piece, with
a slit in it, was carried by apprentices through the streets on St.
Stephen's day, for money. And never a Catholic missionary once sailed
for the Indies, Barbary, or the Islands of the Anthropophagites, but a
box was hung by the priests in the church for alms against his return.
From the former old custom comes our "Boxing Day."</p>

<p>In the Isle of Man, however, the Christmas Box was called the Wren Box,
and for this reason: There dwelt of old a Lorelei, siren or sea-elf,
in the emerald green creeks and caves of a solitary precipitous
island. She was as lovely as she was cruel, and her shrill sweet voice
rose amid the roaring and soughing of the waves in her steep rocky
habitation as shines a poisonous flower in the dark of a forest. Thus
she would at daybreak enchant to their doom sailors following their
craft on the sea. Leaning to listen to this music creeping by them
on the waters, they drew in to her haunts. Of their bones were coral
made; while she lived on; sang on. She was hunted down at last in her
sea-grottoes by those who, like Ulysses, had stopped their ears against
her incantations. Brought finally to bay, her beauty and bright hair
suddenly dwindled and dimmed, and she escaped in the shape of&mdash;Jenny
Wren. Alas, for Jenny Wren! condemned ever after for the woes of this
siren to be pursued with sticks and stones by young loons, cullions and
Jerry Sneaks, on every St. Stephen's Day. As goes the rhyme:</p>

<p>It looks as if this carol&mdash;of Henry VI.'s reign&mdash;was once a singing
game: On the one side in the blaze of the Yule Log the Holly men with
gilded and garlanded pole; and on the other Ivy with her maidens; each
side taunting the other, and maybe tugging for prisoners. "Ivy-girls,"
too, used to be burned by companies of boys, and Holly-boys by
girls&mdash;all yawping and jodelling at the sport.</p>

<p>"Poppynguy" may perhaps be the jay, but it would be pleasanter company
for the lark, if here it means the green woodpecker. His other names
are rain-bird, hew-hole, wood-sprite, woodweele, woodspeek and yaffle,
the very sound of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">[591]</a></span> which is like the echo of his own laughter in the

<h4 id="note_260"><a href="#sn_260">260</a>. "<span class="smcap">When Isicles hang by the Wall.</span>"</h4>

<p>There is a peculiar magic (which may perhaps be less apparent to
the Greenlanders) in icicles. Nor are its effects unknown to the
four-footed. In certain remote regions of Siberia there is said to be a
little animal called the Icc&#279;-vulff (or Ice-wolf). He has prick-ears,
is a fierce feeder, and wears a coat so wondrous close and dense that
three or four of our English moles' skins laid one atop the other would
yet fall short of its match. But he seldom attains to a ripe age, and
for this reason. As soon as he is freed from his dam's snow-burrow, he
hastes off to the dwellings of the men of those parts, snuffing their
dried seal-steaks and blubber, being a most incorrigible thief and
a very wary. And such is his craft that he mocks at gins, traps and
pitfalls. But he has a habit which is often to his undoing. It is in
this wise: The heat of these hovels is apt to melt a little the snow
upon them, its water trickling and coursing softly down till long, keen
icicles are formed, upon which, whether hungry or fed, taking up his
station in a plumb line beneath them, he will squat and gloat for an
hour together, having a marvellous greedy pleasure in clear glasslike
colours. Hearing his breathing or faint snuffing, any human who
wakes within will of a sudden violently shake the wall between. This
dislodges the pendent icicles, and the squatting Icc&#279;-vulff is pierced
to his death as with a sword.</p>

<p>Winter indeed makes crystal even of ink. It has the power of enchanting
every imagination; and particularly Coleridge's:</p>

<p>I remember actually coming upon this poem (in Mr. Nahum's second book),
and how I twisted my head and looked up at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">[595]</a></span> the quiet dark-socketed
skull in its alcove in the turret room. It had no alarm for me then,
though I can recall cold moments of dread or confusion, when I was
a boy, at the thought of death. Then&mdash;or was it some time after?&mdash;I
turned the page and found the following poem by Thomas Campion, and,
in Mr. Nahum's writing, this scrawl at the foot of it: "Yes, but the
vision first."</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">

<p>This solemn dirge was written in "time of pestilence,"&mdash;such a time
as Daniel Defoe tells of in his "Journal of the Plague Year." The
Elizabethan poets brooded endlessly on the mystery of death. A music
haunts their words like that of muffled bells, as in John Fletcher's
poem:</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">

        <div class="i5">Are here remaining.</div>
        <div class="i2">Come hither, fools, and blush you stay so long</div>
        <div class="i5">From being blessed.</div>
        <div class="i2">And mad men, worse than you, that suffer wrong,</div>
        <div class="i5">Yet seek no rest!...</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>And in William Davenant's:</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>Wake, all the dead! What ho! what ho!</div>

        <div>On the decks of the world in storms of love.</div>
        <div>No whisper now nor glance shall pass</div>

        <div>In every grave make room, make room!</div>
        <div>The world's at an end, and we come, we come!...</div>

<p>And this reminds me of an epitaph I chanced on in the graveyard at
Manorbier whose ruinous castle towers above the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">[597]</a></span> green turf of its

<p>Of the <i>Lyke-wake Dirge</i> is known neither the age nor the author. The
body from which the "saule" or spirit within is fled away lies in its
shroud, and the dirge tells of that spirit's journey. Its word "sleet,"
says Mr. Sidgwick, means either salt, for it was the custom to place in
a wooden platter beside the dead, earth and salt for emblems, the one
of corruption, the other of the immortal; or, as some suppose, "sleet"
should be <i>fleet</i>, meaning embers or water or house-room. "Whinnies"
means gorse. To explain the full meaning of Bridge of Dread would need
many pages&mdash;but does not much of that meaning haunt in the very music
and solemnity of the words?</p>


<h4 id="note_279"><a href="#sn_279">279</a>.</h4>

<p>Next this poem in Mr. Nahum's book was "Lead, Kindly Light," and there
was a strange picture for it hanging in the round tower&mdash;the picture
of a small becalmed ship, clumsy of rig and low in the water which was
smooth and green as glass. In the midst of the ship there was piled
high what might be taken for a vast heap of oranges, their fair reddish
colour blazing in the rays of the sun that was about to plunge out
of the greenish sky below the line of the west. But what even more
particularly attracted my eye at the time was that ship's figurehead&mdash;a
curious head and shoulders as if with wings, and of a kind of far
beauty or wonder entirely past me to describe. Many years afterwards I
read that this poem was written by John Henry Newman (one who even in
his young days at Oxford was "never less alone than when alone"), when
his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">[599]</a></span> mind was perplexed and unhappy, and he himself had time to ponder
awhile, because the boat in which he was sailing to England had been
for some days becalmed off the coast of Spain.</p>

little curiously-devised receptacle of silver containing tiny phials
of precious essences&mdash;possibly no bigger than a plum. Or they might
be compounded of rare ingredients: "Your only way to make a good

<p>I have pondered over the thirteenth and eighteenth lines of this poem,
but am not yet certain of all that they were intended to convey. But
what scope for the imagination is in it! The next epitaph is by Stephen
Hawes, whose <i>Passetyme of Pleasure or History of Graunde Amoure, and

<h4 id="note_286"><a href="#sn_286">286</a>. "<span class="smcap">Sidney, O Sidney is dead.</span>"</h4>

<p>"Sir Philip Sydney, Knight," says John Aubrey, "was the most
accomplished courtier of his time. He was not only of an excellent
witt, but extremely beautiful; he much resembled his sister. He was
a person of great courage. Among others Mr. Edmund Spenser made his
addresse to him, and brought his <i>Faery Queen</i>. Sir Philip was busy
at his study, and his servant delivered Mr. Spenser's booke to his
master, who layd it by, thinking it might be such kind of stuffe as
he was frequently troubled with. When Sir Philip perused it, he was
so exceedingly delighted with it, that he was extremely sorry he was
gonne, and where to send for him he knew not. After much enquiry he
learned his lodgeing, and sent for him, and mightily caressed him....
From this time there was a great friendship between them, to his dying
day.... His body was putt in a leaden coffin (which after the firing of
Paule's, I myself sawe), and with wonderfull greate state was carried
to St. Paule's church, when he was buried in our Ladie's Chapell. There
solempnized this funerall all the nobility and great officers of Court."</p>

<p>Here is part of a letter written to him, by his father, Sir Henry
Sidney, in 1566, when Philip was a boy at Shrewsbury School:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Son Philip</span>.... Above all things, tell no untruth.
No, not in trifles. The custom of it is nought: and let it
not satisfy you that, for a time, the hearers take it for a
truth; yet after it will be known as it is, to your shame. For
there cannot be a greater reproach to a gentleman, than to be
accounted a liar.... Remember, my son! the noble blood you are
descended of by your mother's side: and think that only by
virtuous life and good action you may be an ornament to that
illustrious family; otherwise, through vice and sloth, you may
be counted <i>labes generis</i>, "a spot of your kin," one of the
greatest curses that can happen to man.</p></blockquote>

<p>This next fragment is from a letter written on October 18, 1580, by Sir
Philip Sidney himself to his younger brother Robert (then seventeen).
This Robert six years afterwards fought with him at Zutphen. He grew up
a gallant gentleman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">[602]</a></span> was created Earl of Leicester, and in his leisure
wrote words to fit the music of John Dowland&mdash;afterwards lutenist to
Charles I.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p class="i4">For the money you have received, assure yourself (for it is
true), there is nothing I spend so pleaseth me; as that which
is for you. If ever I have ability, you shall find it so: if
not, yet shall not any brother living be better beloved than
you, of me.... Look to your diet, sweet Robin! and hold your
heart in courage and virtue. Truly, great part of my comfort
is in you!.... Be careful of yourself, and I shall never have
cares.... I write this to you as one, that for myself have
given over the delight in the world; but wish to you as much,
if not more, than to myself.... God bless you, sweet Boy! and
accomplish the joyful hope I conceive of you.... Lord how I
have babbled! Once again, farewell, dearest Brother!</p>

<p class="i6">Your most loving and careful brother,</p>

<p class="smcap r1">Philip Sidney</p></blockquote>

<p>And here in a few words is a fleeting glimpse of this renowned man as
he appeared amidst the splendour and magnificence of the Tournament,
during the Anjou Fetes in London, in 1581, five years before his death:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Then proceeded Master Philip Sidney, in very sumptuous manner
with armour part blue and the rest gilt and engraven.... He
had four pages that rode on his four spare horses" (richly
caparisoned in gold and pearls and feathers of silver) "who
had cassock hats and Venetian hose all of cloth of silver laid
with gold lace and hats of the same with gold bands and white
feathers: and each one a pair of white buskins." ... There
followed him in as rich and splendid array his gentlemen,
yeomen, and trumpeters.</p></blockquote>

<p>Of John Donne's Book of Poems there was nothing in Mr. Nahum's first
volume, much in the others. But what I then read of them I little
understood. It is a poetry that awaits the mind as the body grows
older, and when we have ourselves learned the experience of life with
which it is concerned. Not that the simplest poetry will then lose
anything of its grace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603">[603]</a></span> and truth and beauty&mdash;far rather it shines the
more clearly, since age needs it the more.</p>

<p>"<i>His Picture in a sheet</i>" refers to a drawing (prefixed to Donne's
<i>Poems</i>') of his stone effigy. This shows him draped with a shroud,
and may now be seen in St. Paul's Cathedral, of which he was the dean,
and in whose pulpit a few days before his death he preached his last
valedictory or farewell sermon.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas More was such a man. On Monday, July 5th, 1535, the night
before he was beheaded, he wrote ("with a cole") this letter of
farewell to his daughter Margaret Roper. He had seen her for the last
time when she openly met and kissed him in the midst of his enemies and
of the throngs on Tower Wharf, as he came from Judgment:</p>

<p>"Oure Lorde Blesse you good daughter, &amp; youre good husbande, &amp; youre
lyttle boye, &amp; all yours, &amp; all my children, &amp; all my Godde chyldren
and all oure frendes.... I cumber you good <i>Margaret</i> much, but I would
be sory, if it should be any longer than to morow. For it is saint
<i>Thomas</i> even, &amp; the utas of saint <i>Peter</i>: &amp; therfore to morow long
I to go to God: it were a day verye mete &amp; convenient for me. I never
liked your maner toward me better, than whan you kissed me laste: for I
love when doughterly love, and deere charitye, hath no leysure to loke
to worldlye curtesy. Farewell my dere chylde, &amp; pray for me &amp; I shall

<p>There is a legend&mdash;recorded in an ancient monastic chronicle&mdash;that in
the days of Arthur there stretched between Land's End and the Scillies
a country of castles, of fair towns, and landscapes, named Lyonesse.
When the tumult of the last great Arthurian battle was over, there
befell a cataclysm of nature, and in a night of tempest this whole
region was engulfed beneath the seas.</p>

<p>What truth is in this legend no certain history relates. But when the
vast Atlantic breakers begin to lull after storm, to lie listening
in the watches of the night is to hear, it would seem, deep-sunken
belfries of bells sounding in the waters, and siren-like lamentations.
I have myself heard this, and fantasy though it may be, if the ear is
once beguiled into its deceit, the bells clash and chime on and on in
the imagination, mingled with the enormous lully of the surges, until
at last, one falls asleep.</p>

<p>This poem, again, is spelt as the words would be pronounced by the
country people of Dorset, the country in which William Barnes was born
and lived nearly all his long life. Their way of speech is slower
than in common English, and the words, especially those with the two
dots, or diaeresis, over them, should be lingered over a little in
pronouncing them.</p>

<p>Londoners have a way of being scornfully amused at country speech&mdash;in
their ignorance that it is older and far more beautiful than their own
clipped and nasal manner of talking. But half an hour with the great
<i>Dialect Dictionary</i> will prove how inexhaustibly rich the English
language once was and still is in words made, used, and loved by folk
unlearned in books, but with keen and lively eyes in their heads, quick
to see the delight and livingness of a thing, and with the wits to give
it a name fitting it as close as a skin.</p>

<p>"It was my own mother (wrote Thomas Cantimpratanus about 1260) who told
me the story which I am about to relate. My grandmother had a firstborn
son of most excellent promise, comely beyond the wont of children, at
whose death she mourned ... with a grief that could not be consoled,
until one day, as she went by the way, she saw in her vision a band
of youths moving onwards, as it seemed to her, with exceeding great
joy; and she, remembering her son and weeping that she saw him not in
this joyful band, suddenly beheld him trailing weary footsteps after
the rest. Then with a grievous cry the mother asked: 'How comes it,
my son, that thou goest alone, lagging thus behind the rest?' Then he
opened the side of his cloak and showed her a heavy water-pot, saying:
'Behold, dear mother, the tears which thou hast vainly shed for me,
through the weight whereof I must needs linger behind the rest! Thou
therefore shalt turn thy tears to God: then only shall I be freed from
the burden wherewith I am now grieved.'"</p>

<p>But not all dreamers are so rebuked or so comforted. St. Augustine, a
loving son, pined in vain:</p>

<p>"If the dead could come in dreams," he wrote, "my pious mother would
no night fail to visit me. Far be the thought that she should, by a
happier life, have been made so cruel that, when aught vexes my heart,
she should not even console in a dream the son whom she loved with an
only love."</p>


<h4 id="note_310"><a href="#sn_310">310</a>. <span class="smcap">Tom o' Bedlam.</span></h4>

<p>This poem has been at hide-and-seek with the world for many years past.
Mr. Frank Sidgwick has now played Seek, however, and has tracked it
down in the British Museum in a manuscript, No. 24665, inscribed "Giles
Earle&mdash;his book, 1615." In this manuscript the poem consists of eight
stanzas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">[607]</a></span> of ten lines each, with a chorus of five lines. The version in
this book is only of twenty-five lines, as they were arranged by Mrs.
Meynell in her beautiful Anthology, <i>The Flower of the Mind</i>. Here are
the chief differences which Mr. Sidgwick has very kindly allowed me to
collect from his account of his search:</p>

<p>Line 1, "moon" is <i>morn</i>. Line 2, "lovely" is <i>lonely</i>, "marrow" is
<i>morrow</i>. Line 10, "rounded" is <i>wounded</i>. Line 16, "a heart" is a
<i>host</i>. And line 21, "with" is <i>by</i>. It is a happy exercise of the wits
to choose between them and to find reasons for one's choice. When and
by whom the poem was written is not yet known. It remains a shining
jewel in the crown of the most modest of all men of genius, Mr. Anon.</p>


<h4 id="note_314"><a href="#sn_314">314</a>. "<span class="smcap">What's in there.</span>"</h4>

<p>This far-carrying rhyme belongs to the ancient and famous game of Dump.
"He who speaks first in it," says Dr. Gregor, "or laughs first, or lets
his teeth be seen, gets nine nips, nine nobs, nine double douncornes,
an' a gueed blow on the back o' the head."</p>

<p>The <i>faht</i> and <i>fahr</i>, I suppose, are the pleasant Scots way of saying
<i>what</i> and <i>where</i>.</p>


<h4 id="note_316"><a href="#sn_316">316</a>.</h4>

<p>So may the omission of a few commas effect a wonder in the imagination.
To the imagination indeed there is nothing absurd in, "I saw the sun
at twelve o'clock at night"&mdash;for one can actually <i>see</i> in the "little
nowhere of the mind" both burning sun and black night <i>together</i>: as
once in a dream I myself was enchanted by three moons in the sky,
shining in their silver above waters as wide as those of Milton's
curfew. So, too, even mere day-by-day objects will take on themselves a
strangeness and beauty never seen or "marked" before, if (like Marcus
Aurelius and his loaf of bread) we will only "glut" the eye on them. "I
see a rose," said an old woman on her deathbed, "but if, in childhood
and youth, I had seen it closer, what a rose on the threshold it had
been!"</p>

<p>Here is another old nursery "nonsense" rhyme that makes almost as
lively pictures in the mind:</p>

<p>"The Tuatha De Danaan&mdash;the divine Children of Danu which forgotten
centuries ago invaded Ireland&mdash;can take all shapes, and those that
are in the waters take often the shape of fish. A woman of Burren, in
Galway, says, 'There are more of them in the sea than on the land ...,'
and another Galway woman says, 'Surely those things are in the sea as
well as on land. My father was out fishing one night off Tyrone. And
something came beside the boat that had eyes shining like candles. And
then a wave came in, and a storm rose all in a minute, and whatever was
in the wave, the weight of it had like to sink the boat. And then they
saw that it was a woman in the sea that had the shining eyes. So my
father went to the priest, and he bid him always to take a drop of holy
water and a pinch of salt out in the boat with him, and nothing could
harm him.'"</p>

<p>The story is of how a bright lady comes to keep her tryst with a
knight-at-arms in the golden broom of Hive Hill. She finds him under
a charm, an enchantment, asleep; and having left her ring on his
finger for proof of her coming, she steals away. Presently after he
awakes&mdash;her presence gone. To leave a quiet and happy room vacant at
night is sometimes to have this experience, as it were, <i>reversed</i>.
There comes a feeling that you being gone, gentler visitants may enter
and share its solitude&mdash;while its earthly occupant sleeps overhead, and
one by one the stars sink to their setting.</p>

<p>It is difficult to read this poem slowly and intently enough if one is

desolation. Take even, of all there is, but the "peering mouse" in
the sixth stanza&mdash;his sharp nose sniffing the air beneath the small
wooden arch of his dark-glimmering mousery, where miche and shriek and
gambol his fellows behind the mouldering wainscot. Or stay for a moment
looking down on the "marsh mosses" in the third stanza&mdash;of a green as
lively as a fairy's mantle in the sunlight, gilding the waters of the
blackened sluice. So piece by piece the words of the poem build up in
the imagination this solitary house with its forsaken Mariana, whom
Tennyson himself had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_610" id="Page_610">[610]</a></span> seen in the dream conferred on him by another

<p>Of the dangerous plant Mandrake ("its root in something the shape and
appearance of a man") is concocted Mandragora, one of the "drowsy
syrups." "The leaves and fruit be also dangerous, for they cause deadly
sleep, and peevish drowsiness." The fruit is "of the bigness of a
reasonable pippin, and as yellow as gold when it is thoroughly ripe":
fair without, ashes within. It is said that the mandrake's screams,
when it is dragged out of the ground, will send the hearer mad. So
the gatherer should first seal his ears, then tie the plant to a
dog's tail and hike him on to haul it out of its haunt! "Avicenna the
Arabian physician asserts that a Jew at Metz had a mandragore with a
human head, and the legs and body of a cock, which lived five weeks,
and was fed on lavender and earthworms, and, when dead, was preserved
in spirits." Even up to the nineteenth century dreaders or wishers of
witchcraft were wont to carry these monstrous little Erdmannikens in

<p>Hemlock is that tall, dim-spotted plant of a sad green colour, and of
a scent "strong, heady and bad," which is "very cold and dangerous,"
especially when "digged in the dark."</p>

<p>Clammy henbane is woolly-leafed, with hollow dark-eyed flowers of a
purple-veined dingy yellow. "It lusts to grow in rancid soil, To 'stil
its deadly oil."</p>

<p>Moonwort is the meek-looking little flowering fern that has the power
to break locks, and to make any horse that chances to tread upon it
cast his shoes.</p>

<p>The livid-flowered, cherry like-fruited dwale, enoron, or nightshade is
the most "daungerous" plant in England. While leopard's bane&mdash;though it
bears a bright-yellow daisy-like flower, and witches are said to fear
sun-colour&mdash;is venomous to animals.</p>

<p>I am uncertain of adder's tongue, for the fern of this name cures sore
eyes; and cuckoo-pint which is also so called, is "a remedy for poison
and the plague"!</p>

<p>Of these six insidious plants only one is openly mentioned by
Shakespeare, and they appear to have few country names, unlike,
for example, the purple orchis, "which has so many," says Nicholas
Culpeper, "that they would fill a sheet of paper": long-purples,
dead-men's fingers, crake-feet, giddy-gandy, neat-legs, geese and

  </div>

<p>"Seventeen or eighteen years ago," wrote Coleridge in 1817, "an artist
of some celebrity was so pleased with this doggerel that he amused
himself with the thought of making a Child's Picture Book of it; but he
could not hit on a picture for the four lines beginning, 'Many Autumns,
many Springs.' I suggested a <i>Round-about</i> with four seats, and the
four seasons, as children, with Time for the shew-man."</p>

<h4 id="note_335"><a href="#sn_335">335</a>. "<span class="smcap">A thousand darling Imps.</span>" (stanza 19)</h4>

<p>"Aeriel spirits," says Robert Burton, "are such as keep quarter most
part in the air, cause many tempests, thunder, and lightnings, tear
oaks, fire steeples, houses, strike men and beasts, make it rain
stones, ... wool, frogs, etc., counterfeit armies in the air, strange
noises, swords, etc."</p>

<p>Nothing vexed Linnet Sara more than to be asked if there were any such
darling imps or spectres or ghosts or blackamoors in Thrae. All such to
her were nothing but idle fiddle-faddle. But Reginald Scot, who wrote
<i>The Discoverie of Witchcraft</i> (1584), had another kind of kitchen
company when he was young.</p>

<p>" ... Our mothers maide," he says, of his childhood, "so terrified
us with ... bull beggers, spirits, witches, urchens, elves, hags,
fairies, satyrs, pans, faunes, sylens, kit with the cansticke,
tritons, centaurs, dwarfes, giants, imps, calcars, conjurors, nymphes,
changlings, Incubus, Robin goodfellowe, the spoorne, the mare, the man
in the oke, the hellwaine, the fierdrake, the puckle, Tom thombe, hob
gobblin, Tom tumbler, boneles, and such other bugs, that we were afraid
of our own shadowes: in so much as some never feare the divill, but in
a dark night; ..."</p>

<p>There seems to be no mention here of the salamander&mdash;a creature at
least as rarely seen by mortal eyes as the puckle or firedrake.</p>

<p>"When I was about five years old," says Benvenuto Cellini, "my father
happened to be in a basement-chamber of our house, where they had been
washing, and where a good fire of oak logs was still burning; he had a
viol in his hand and was playing and singing alone beside the fire. The
weather was very cold. Happening to look into the fire, he espied in
the middle of the most burning flames a little creature like a lizard,
which was sporting in the core of the intensest coals. Becoming aware
of what the thing was, he had my sister and me called, and pointing it
out to us children, gave me a great box on the ears, which caused me to
cry with all my might. Then he pacified me by saying, 'My dear little
boy, I am not striking you for anything that you have done, but only to
make you remember that the lizard you see in the fire is a salamander,
a creature which has never been seen before by any of whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_614" id="Page_614">[614]</a></span> we have
credible information.' So saying he gave me some pieces of money, and
kissed me."</p>


<h4>"<span class="smcap">Bell and Whip and Horse's Tail</span>" (stanza 22)</h4>

<p>&mdash;such in old days was the Witch's vile punishment if she escaped
drowning: to be whipped, tied to a horse's tail, and rung through the
crowded streets.</p>

<p>"Agramie," I suppose, is agrimony, which, if worn by the wary, will
enable the wearer to detect witches. Their eyes too will betray them,
for <i>there</i> you will find no tiny image of yourself reflected as in the
eyes of the honest. And if you would be rid of their company, pluck a
sprig of scarlet pimpernel, and repeat this charm:</p>

<p>is a fiend that haunts in rivers and desolate waters. It is of
horse-shape, and the sound of its neighings is a boding of death to the
traveller.</p>

<p>"Thus did the evil creatures often press me hard, but, as was meet, I
served them well with my war-sword; they had no joyous fill by eating
me, wicked destroyers, sitting round their feast nigh the bottom of the
sea; but in the morning, wounded by the sword, slain by the dagger,
they lay up along the sea-strand, so that they could never more hinder
seafarers on their course in the deep channel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_615" id="Page_615">[615]</a></span></p>

<p>Light came from the east, the bright beacon of the Lord; the waves were
stilled, and I could descry the sea-headlands, those wind-swept walls."</p>

<p class="r1"><i>Beowulf</i>, translated by <span class="smcap">C. B. Tinker</span></p>

<p>"'And what is the sea?' asked Will.</p>

<p>'The sea!' cried the miller. 'Lord help us all, it is the greatest
thing God made! That is where all the water in the world runs down
into a great salt lake. There it lies, as flat as my hand and as
innocent-like as a child; but they do say when the wind blows it gets
up into water-mountains bigger than any of ours, and swallows down
great ships bigger than our mill, and makes such a roaring that you can
hear it miles away upon the land. There are great fish in it five times
bigger than a bull, and one old serpent as long as our river and as old
as all the world, with whiskers like a man, and a crown of silver on
her head.'"</p>

<p class="smcap r1">Robert Louis Stevenson</p>


<h4 id="note_341"><a href="#sn_341">341</a>. "<span class="smcap">The Wandering Spectre.</span>"</h4>

<p>" ... The usewall Method for a curious Person to get a transient Sight
of this otherwise invisible Crew of Subterraneans, ... is to put his
left Foot under the Wizard's right Foot, and the Seer's Hand is put on
the Inquirer's Head, who is to look over the Wizard's right Shoulder
... then will he see a Multitude of Wights, like furious hardie Men,
flocking to him haistily from all Quarters, as thick as Atoms in the
Air.... Thes thorow Fear strick him breathless and speechless."</p>

<p>So says "Mr. Robert Kirk, Minister at Aberfoill," in his <i>Secret
Commonwealth</i> of 1691.</p>

<p>Of these invisible wights the womenkind "are said to Spin very fine,
to Dy, to Tossue, and Embroyder, but whether only curious Cob-webs,
impalpable Rainbows ... I leave to conjecture."</p>


<h4 id="note_343"><a href="#sn_343">343</a>. "<span class="smcap">And Clootie's waur nor a Woman was.</span>" (stanza 19)</h4>

<p>A strip or patch of wild weedy uncropped ground (like the Sluggard's
garden) that in England is called <i>No Man's Land</i>, the Scots country
folk call <i>Clootie's Croft</i> (or Clootie's little field). They hand
it over by name, as it were, to the Fiend,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_616" id="Page_616">[616]</a></span> hoping that he may rest
content with its harvest of nettle and bramble and burr, and not range
elsewhere. It is an old belief that if, like Christian, the wayfarer
meets Apollyon straddling across his path, he may have to withstand him
not only with sword and staff, but with his wits. Just so, too, in old
times, sovereign princes would test strangers with dark questions and
riddles. In this ballad the Fiend disguised as a knight comes wooing
at a Widow's door, in the next he is abroad on the high road. Jennifer
and the wee boy kept up their hearts, their wits about them, their eyes
open, and "had the last word"; which, says Mr. Sidgwick, is a mighty
powerful charm against evil spirits&mdash;as against Witches are the herbs
vervain, dill, basil, hyssop, periwinkle and rue. Iron, too; the cross,
and running water.</p>

<p>Here is another such encounter from <i>The White Wallet</i>&mdash;packed with
poems new and old. You can almost hear the voices of the two speakers

<p>I have included only these few stanzas of this familiar magical poem
because a book is but one book, and to print everything as lovely or
almost as lovely would need many.</p>

<p>In reading it, as Coleridge explained, all that is necessary to ensure
its lilt and cadence is to remember that every line, however few or
many its words or syllables, has four accents, and that these fall in
accord with the meaning of the lines as one reads them with clear eyes,
attentive ear, and understanding. In his tale of Genevieve there is yet
another false and lovely Fiend:</p>

<h4>"<span class="smcap">A Toothless Mastiff Bitch.</span>"</h4>

<p>Here is a description of one <i>with</i> teeth&mdash;a dog seldom seen now. It is
taken from a German book on husbandry, translated by Barnaby Goodge,
and is quoted in <i>Animal Lore</i>:</p>

<p>"First the mastie that keepeth the house: for this purpose you must
provide you such a one, as hath a large and a mightie body, a great
and a shrill voyce, that both with his barking he may discover, and
with his sight dismay the theefe, yea, being not seene, with the
horror of his voice put him to flight; his stature must neither be
long nor short, but well set, his head great, his eyes sharpe, and
fiery, ... his countenance like a lion, his brest great and shaghayrd,
his shoulders broad, his legges bigge, his tayle short, his feet very
great; his disposition must neither be too gentle, nor too curst, that
he neither fawne upon a theefe, nor flee (fly) upon his friends; very
waking, no gadder abroad, not lavish of his mouth, barking without
cause. Neither maketh it any matter though he be not swift: for he is
but to fight at home, and to give warning of the enemie." And his name
is little Bingo!</p>

candle in a silver shrine:</p>

<p>"The bride being attired in a gown of sheeps russet, and a kirtle of
fine worsted, her head attired with a billiment of gold, and her hair
as yellow as gold hanging down behind her, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_623" id="Page_623">[623]</a></span> was curiously combed
and pleated, according to the manner in those days: she was led to
church between two sweet boys, with bride-laces and rosemary tied about
their silken sleeves.... Then was there a fair bride-cup of silver and
gilt carried before her wherein was a goodly branch of rosemary, gilded
very fair, hung about with silken ribands of all colours: next was
there a noise of musicians, that played all the way before her: after
her came all the chiefest maidens of the country, some bearing great
bride-cakes, and some garlands of wheat, finely gilded, and so she
passed to the Church."</p>

<p>As for the silken ribands they may have been of Drakes colour or Ladies
blush or Gozelinge colour or Marigold or Isabel or Peas porridge tawny
or Popingay blew or Lusty gallant, but they were certainly not Judas
colour, Devil in the hedge, or Dead Spaniard.</p>

<p>In old times the "Governor" of a Bee Hive was sometimes referred to as
the King and sometimes as the Queen. The choice depended in part on
which kind of monarch was on the throne. There is an entrancing story
of the middle ages, told by Mr. Tickner Edwardes in his book on the
Honey Bee.</p>

<p>"A certaine simple woman, on finding that her bees were storing little
honey for her and were perishing of "the murraine," stole one of the
holy wafers from the priest, and for miraculous remedy concealed it
in one of her hives. "Whereupon the Murraine ceased and the Honie
abounded. The Woman, therefore lifting up the hive at the due time to
take out the Honie, saw there (most strange to be seene) a Chappell
built by the Bees, with an altar to it, the wals adorned by marvellous
skill of architecture, with windowes conveniently set in their places:
also a doore and a steeple with bells. And the Host being laid upon
the altar, the Bees making a sweet noise, flew around it." Apart from
"the singing masons building roofs of gold," the gluttonous drones,
the sentries, wax-makers, bread-kneaders, nurses, etc., there are the
Queen's Ladies-in-waiting. "For difference from the rest they beare
for their crest a tuft or tossell, in some coloured yellow, in some
murrey, in manner of a plume; whereof some turne downward like an
Ostrich-feather, others stand upright like a Hern-top." But for truths
even stranger than fantasy regarding bees and their kind, go to Henri
Fabre.</p>

<p>The word screen (line 4) means, I think, "Hide and shelter those smiles
away that in their beauty seem to burn in the air": for all beauty
resembles radiance in its influence on the mind. And this recalls to
memory Southwell's poem, <i>The Burning Babe</i>, No. 256.</p>


<h4 id="note_364"><a href="#sn_364">364</a>. "<span class="smcap">A Sonnet of the Moon.</span>"</h4>

<p>The closer one looks at and examines a fine <i>sonnet</i>&mdash;its way of
rhyming, its rise, poise, flight and fall, the ease and exactitude with
which what is said in it fills its mould or form&mdash;the more, I was going
to say, one should hesitate before attempting to write another. This
particular sonnet (like No. 361), is of the English or Shakespearean
kind, and is so lovely a thing that only a close attention would notice
the carelessness of its rhymes. No. 342 is an example of the form which
our sixteenth century poets borrowed from Italy. Comparison of them
shows that, as with the old Chinese ginger jars, so in poetry: not only
is the syrup delightful, but even the pot may be interesting.</p>

<p>Coleridge wrote few sonnets, and this is his explanation of the length
one must be: "It is confined to fourteen lines, because as some
particular number is necessary, and that particular number must be a
small one, it may as well be fourteen as any other number. When no
reason can be adduced against a thing, Custom is a sufficient reason
for it."</p>

<p>When I read this last remark for the first time it was as if my mind
had been startled into attention as one's body is when it collides
with a stranger in the street. There is a wide wisdom in it. How many
natural, human and delightful things there are in this world indeed for
which Custom is a sufficient reason: Children, for instance, daisies
in the grass,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_626" id="Page_626">[626]</a></span> skylarks in the clouds, dreams in sleep, rhymes, gay
clothes, friendship, laughter.</p>


<h4>"<span class="smcap">The Pale Queen.</span>"</h4>

<p>There is the apparition of a lovely face in the Moon&mdash;proud and
mute&mdash;to be discovered by careful eyes usually on the extreme right of
the disc, her own eyes gazing towards the left.</p>


<h4 id="note_368"><a href="#sn_368">368</a>. "<span class="smcap">It was in and about the Martinmas time.</span>"</h4>

<p>This old Scottish song was a favourite of Oliver Goldsmith's in his
childhood. "The music of the finest singer," he said, "is dissonance
to what I felt when our old dairy-maid sung me into tears with <i>Johnny
Armstrong's Last Good-night</i>, or <i>The Cruelty of Barbara Allen</i>.</p>

<p>As with the Scottish ballads so with this last poem&mdash;it is the brevity
and bareness with which the story is told and is not told that sets it
apart. Without one express word to prove it so, we know that Sir John
had always loved the proud Barbara even though he had spoken lightly of
her, and that she too had always loved him, though she refuses the word
that would have saved his life.</p>


<h4 id="note_371"><a href="#sn_371">371</a>. "<span class="smcap">I Never Had but One True Love, in Cold Grave She was
Lain.</span>"</h4>

<p>Yet another tragic and sorrowful poem of which, to some fancies, there
may be too many in this book already. Well, here is the story of the
beautiful Princess Uillanita: She cared only for flowers white and
colourless as dew in the first light of day, or as laundered linen
blanching on a hedge of thorn. And she came one still evening, when she
was in search of what she could not find, to a valley wherein a forest
gloomed above a deep but placid river. Within the forest, refreshed by
the mists of the river, grew none but flowers blue and dark and purple,
and such was the young Princess's hatred of them that she covered her
eyes with her hands, fled on, and so lost her way.</p>

<p>In the middle of the night and long after she had wept herself to
sleep, the wailing of a nocturnal bird pierced into her dreams, and she
woke to find one solitary star of the colourlessness of Vega shining
alone in radiance in the space of sky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_627" id="Page_627">[627]</a></span> betwixt the branches above her
head. Its thin ray silvered down&mdash;spearlike in its straightness&mdash;and
of a beam easily sufficing to irradiate a tiny clustering flower
which stood scarcely visible in the moss at her hand's side, and was
drenching the air with its fragrance. It was a flower utterly strange
to her, whiter than hoarfrost, fairer than foam.</p>

<p>The enravished Princess gazed spellbound. "Why," whispered she to
herself, in the quiet of the dark gigantic forest; "if I had not wept
at the flowers of this sombre forest, if I had not lost my way, if I
had not been moved in my sleep to awaken, I never should have seen this
crystal thing; that is lovelier than I deemed Paradise itself could
bring to bloom." And she kissed the thin-spun petals, and happily fell
again asleep.</p>

<p>In this poem, as in all Christina Rossetti's work, there is a rhythm

will vanish as rapidly as the bloom from a plum. Indeed, each stanza is
like a branch (with its twigs) of a wild damson-tree, its wavering line
broken and beautified with bud, flower and leaf. And certainly as fresh
an air, and as clear a light, stirs and dwells in the poem as on the
tree itself in April.</p>

<p>In medieval days it seems that a traveller here and there, happily
supposing the world to be a floating island of indiscoverable
dimensions, hung in the wilds of space, and not knowing that it was
merely an "oblate spheroid," would journey clean round it and so come
back, to his amazement, to the place from which he started. Here is
such an experience from Sir John Mandeville, in his own words: "It was
told that a certain worthy man departed some time from our Country for
to go search the World.... He passed India and the Isles beyond it,
where are more than 5000 Isles, and so long and for so many seasons he
went by Sea and Land, and so environed the World, that he came at last
to an Isle whereon he heard spoken his own language&mdash;a calling of oxen
in the Plough&mdash;such Words in fact as men were wont to speak to Beasts
in his own country. Whereof he greatly marvelled, knowing not how that
might be." For there&mdash;as if it were a ghost or spectre&mdash;<i>there</i> was
the chimney of his own house smoking up into the clear morning air!
And what did he do, maybe? He stared; he sighed; he grew pale; he
shuddered: and&mdash;he turned back!</p>

by William Cleland while he was still at St. Andrews. All else I
know of him is that he was born about 1661, and fell at Dunkeld in
1689. There is nothing in English to my knowledge that resembles
it. <i>Erra Pater</i> (stanza 4) was the name given to a busy astrologer
and almanac-concocter, William Lilly, of the time. King Phalaris's
monstrous bull was of brass: he perished in it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_630" id="Page_630">[630]</a></span></p>

<p>By "the tapers" (stanza 2) is meant, I fancy, those phosphor-like fires
that gather on the yard-arms of ships at sea when the air is electric
with tempest. Sir Humphrey Gilbert's sailors were fearful at sight of
this apparition, and of a monster, too, that appeared swimming in the
waves beside their frigate, the <i>Squirrel</i>, a little before she and her
riding lights disappeared for ever.</p>

<p>" ... Men which all their life time had occupied the Sea, never saw
more outragious Seas. We had also upon our maine yard, an apparition of
a little fire by night, which seamen doe call Castor and Pollux. But we
had onely one, which they take an evill signe of more tempest.... The
same Monday night, about twelve of the clocke ... suddenly her lights
were out ... and withall our watch cryed, <i>the Generall was cast away</i>,
which was too true. For in that moment, the Frigat was devoured and
swallowed up of the Sea ..."</p>

<p>As for Cupid (stanza 5), he is said to be the slyest archer that ever
shot arrow&mdash;and a dangerous child either to entertain (as the poem
proves that begins as follows):</p>

<p>" ... The next day, Thursday, October 11, 1492, was destined to be for
ever memorable in the history of the world.... The people on the <i>Santa
Maria</i> saw some petrels and a green branch in the water; the <i>Pinta</i>
saw a reed and two small sticks carved with iron, and one or two other
pieces of reeds and grasses that had been grown on shore, as well as
a small board. Most wonderful of all, the people of the <i>Nina</i> saw 'a
little branch full of dog roses';.... The day drew to its close; and
after nightfall, according to their custom, the crews of the ships
repeated the <i>Salve Regina</i>. Afterwards the Admiral addressed the
people and sailors of his ship, 'very merry and pleasant,'.... The moon
was in its third quarter, and did not rise until eleven o'clock. The
first part of the night was dark, and there was only a faint starlight
into which the anxious eyes of the look-out men peered from the
forecastles of the three ships. At ten o'clock Columbus was walking on
the poop of his vessel, when he suddenly saw a light right ahead. The
light seemed to rise and fall as though it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_632" id="Page_632">[632]</a></span> were a candle or a lantern
held in some one's hand and waved up and down. The Admiral called Pedro
Gutierrez to him and asked him whether he saw anything; and he also
saw the light. Then he sent for Rodrigo Sanchez and asked him if he
saw the light; but he did not.... Dawn came at last, flooding the sky
with lemon and saffron and scarlet and orange, until at last the pure
gold of the sun glittered on the water. And when it rose it showed the
sea-weary mariners an island lying in the blue sea ahead of them: the
island of Guanahani; San Salvador....</p>

<h4 id="note_396"><a href="#sn_396">396</a>. "<span class="smcap">Jewels more rich than Ormus shows.</span>" (line 20)</h4>

<p>Mr. Nahum's picture to this was of a man clothed in rags that must
once have been rich and pompous. He sits, in the picture, gnawing his
nails upon a heap of what appears to be precious stones and lumps of
gold. All around him stretch the sands of the seashore, and there is
a little harbour with a decayed quay, its river-mouth silted up with
ooze and flotsam, so that nothing but a row-boat could find entrance
there. An<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_634" id="Page_634">[634]</a></span> immense sun burns in the sky; and, though a thread of fresh
water flows nearby, the man among the jewels seems to be tormented with
thirst. For Ormus, or Hormuz, on its narrow island of wild-coloured
rocks, date-palms, parrots and many birds, was once the rich mart
and treasure-house between Persia and India&mdash;spices, pearls, ivory,
gold, precious stones, and, in particular, the diamond, being its
merchandise. In 1507 the Portuguese Conqueror Alfonso Albuquerque stole
it from its dark princes. In 1622 Shah Abbas the Great razed it to the
ground. To-day it is but a waste, inhabited by a few fishermen and
diggers, its only commodities&mdash;that once were gems&mdash;salt and sulphur;
while still in the height of its Summer blows Julot, Harmatan, Il
Sirocco, the Flame-Wind, so deadly in its breath that the troops of
an army of 1600 horsemen and 6000 foot, says Marco Polo, marching to
punish the city for neglecting to pay tribute to the King of Kîrman,
and camping overnight without its walls, were baked next noon as dry
as pumice, and not a voice among them to tell the tale, though their
bodily shape and colour seemed to appearance unchanged. To protect
themselves against this Julot, the citizens of Ormus would build huts
of sheltering osier-work over the water, and in the heat of the morning
would stand immersed in its coolness up to the chin.</p>


<h4>"<span class="smcap">Apples</span>" (line 23)</h4>

<p class="p-left">&mdash;these are pineapples, the "price" of the next line meaning
excellence. "Ambergris" (line 28), is a rare and costly stuff which, as
its name tells, resembles grey amber. It has a wondrously sweet smell,
was once used in cooking, and is disgorged by the whale that supplies
the world with the comforting ointment of childhood called Spermaceti.</p>

<p>In Shakespeare's day, Marvell's "remote Bermudas" were known as the
"Isle of Divels"&mdash;because of the nocturnal yellings, cries and yelpings
that were reported to haunt them. English sailors, wrecked and cast
away on Great Bermuda in 1709, however, brought home in their boats of
cedar-wood the news that this wild music was caused (at least in part)
by descendants of the hogs that had been left there by the long-gone
Spaniard, Juan Bermudez and his men! They told, too, that it was an
island fair and commodious, of a gentle climate, and a sweet-smelling
air; and Shakespeare almost certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_635" id="Page_635">[635]</a></span> had its enchantments in
mind when he wrote of Ariel, Caliban and Miranda. Was not Ariel in
Prospero's more solitary days called up at midnight "to fetch dewe from
the still-vext Bermoothes"?</p>

<p>To the Puritan voyagers of Andrew Marvell's poem the Islands were as
welcome and angelic as the Hesperides. And no poet could better tell
of them than he. For in Marvell's verse dwells a curious happiness,
like sunshine on a pool of water-lilies. Yet he, too, like other
dreamers, was a man of affairs, and of endless industry and zeal. He
was thrice Member of Parliament for his birthplace, Kingston-on-Hull,
and, with Milton, was one of Oliver Cromwell's Latin Secretaries. John
Aubrey describes him as "of a middling stature, pretty strong sett,
roundish face, cherry-cheek't, hazell eie, brown hair. He was in his
conversation very modest, and of very few words. And though he loved
wine, he would never drink heartilie in company, and was wont to say,
that, <i>he would not play the good fellow in any man's company in whose
hands he would not trust his life</i>.... He lies interred under the pewes
in the south side of St. Giles' church-in-the-fields, under the window
wherein is painted in glass a red lyon...." And there George Chapman,
William Shirley, and Lord Herbert of Cherbury share his rest.</p>

<p>The prose "argument" to the "Ancient Mariner," which is almost as rare
a piece of reading as the Rime itself, has been omitted. But here is
a fragment of it relating to the passage on pages 390-4: "...The
Wedding-Guest feareth that a Spirit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_636" id="Page_636">[636]</a></span> is talking to him; but the ancient
Mariner assureth him of his bodily life, and proceedeth to relate his
horrible penance. He despiseth the creatures of the calm, and envieth
that <i>they</i> should live, and so many lie dead. But the curse liveth
for him in the eye of the dead men. In his loneliness and fixedness
he yearneth towards the journeying Moon, and the stars that still
sojourn, yet still move onward; and every where the blue sky belongs to
them, and is their appointed rest, and their native country and their
own natural homes, which they enter unannounced, as lords that are
certainly expected and yet there is a silent joy at their arrival.</p>

<p>"By the light of the Moon he beholdeth God's creatures of the great
calm&mdash;their beauty and their happiness. He blesseth them in his heart.
The spell begins to break. By grace of the holy Mother, the ancient
Mariner is refreshed with rain. He heareth sounds and seeth strange
sights and commotions in the sky and the element. The bodies of the
ship's crew are inspired and inspirited, and the ship moves on; but not
by the souls of the men, nor by dæmons of earth or middle air, but by
a blessed troop of angelic spirits, sent down by the invocation of the
guardian saint...."</p>

<p>"Daemons of earth or middle air" have been told of also by land
travellers&mdash;by Friar Odoric, for example, in the account of his journey
through Cathay during the years 1316-1330:</p>

<p>"Another great and terrible thing I saw. For, as I went through a
certain valley which lieth by the River of Delights, I saw therein many
dead corpses lying. And I heard also therein sundry kinds of music, but
chiefly nakers, which were marvellously played upon. And so great was
the noise thereof that very great fear came upon me. Now, this valley
is seven or eight miles long; and if any unbeliever enter therein he
quitteth it never again, but perisheth incontinently. Yet I hesitated
not to go in that I might see once for all what the matter was. And
when I had gone in I saw there, as I have said, such numbers of corpses
as no one without seeing it could deem credible. And at one side of the
valley, in the very rock, I beheld as it were the face of a man very
great and terrible, so very terrible indeed that for my exceeding great
fear my spirit seemed to die in me. Wherefore I made the sign of the
cross, and began continually to repeat <span class="smcap">VERBUM CARO FACTUM</span>,
but I dared not at all to come nigh that face, but kept at seven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_637" id="Page_637">[637]</a></span> or
eight paces from it. And so I came at length to the other end of the
valley, and there I ascended a hill of sand and looked around me. But
nothing could I descry, only I still heard those nakers to play which
were played so marvellously. And when I got to the top of that hill I
found there a great quantity of silver heaped up as it had been fishes'
scales, and some of this I put into my bosom. But as I cared nought
for it, and was at the same time in fear lest it should be a snare to
hinder my escape, I cast it all down again to the ground. And so by
God's grace I came forth scathless. Then all the Saracens, when they
heard of this, showed me great worship, saying that I was a baptised
and holy man. But those who had perished in that valley they said
belonged to the devil."</p>

<h4 id="note_400"><a href="#sn_400">400</a>. "<span class="smcap">Parrots of Shrilly Green</span>"</h4>

<p>&mdash;this gaudy and longevous bird, that seems to contain all the wisdom
of Solomon and more than the craft of Cleopatra in his eye, perched
first upon England many centuries ago. Skelton speaks of him:</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>My name is parrot, a bird of Paradise ...</div>

        <div>My little legges, my fete both nete and cleane....</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>And so, too, John Maplet, a "naturalist" who in 1567 wrote <i>A Greene
Forest</i>:</p>

<p>"The Parret hath all hir whole bodie greene, saving that onely about
hir necke she hath a Coller or Chaine naturally wrought like to Sinople
or Vermelon. Indie hath of this kinde such as will counterfaite redily

There have bene found of these that have saluted Emperours...."</p>

<p>But which Emperors, and when and to what end he does not relate.
A parrot of price indeed would be she that had held converse with
"Ozymandias, king of kings."</p>

<h4 id="note_403"><a href="#sn_403">403</a>. "<span class="smcap">The Wild Hyaena.</span>" (line 11)</h4>

<p>In old times it was believed that if a hungry hyaena or jaccatray&mdash;who
cannot wry his neck "because his backbone stretches itself out to the
head"&mdash;dreams, he dreams so vividly that he calls into his sleeping
brain a vision of the beasts he covets for prey. And this vision is so
lifelike that he howls out of his sleep in mockery of the beasts&mdash;and
thus decoys them to his den! He is a nocturnal scavenger, haunting
graveyards, and "when" says Lyly, he "speaketh lyke a man," he
"deviseth most mischief."</p>


<h4 id="note_404"><a href="#sn_404">404</a>. "<span class="smcap">In Xanadu Did Kubla Khan.</span>"</h4>

<p>"Now, this lord (the Great Caan)," says Friar Odoric in his <i>Cathay</i>,
"passeth the summer at a certain place which is called SANDU, situated
towards the north, and the coolest habitation in the world. But in the
winter season he abideth in Cambalech. And when he will ride from the
one place to the other this is the order thereof. He hath four armies
of horsemen, one of which goeth a day's march in front of him, one at
each side, and one a day's march in rear, so that he goeth always as
it were, in the middle of a cross. And marching thus, each army hath
its route laid down for it day by day, and findeth at its halts all
necessary provender. But his own immediate company hath its order of
march thus. The king travelleth in a two-wheeled carriage, in which is
formed a very goodly chamber, all of lign-aloes and gold, and covered
over with great and fine skins, and set with many precious stones. And
the carriage is drawn by four elephants, well broken in and harnessed,
and also by four splendid horses, richly caparisoned. And alongside
go four barons, who are called CUTHE, keeping watch and ward over the
chariot that no hurt come to the king. Moreover, he carrieth with him
in his chariot twelve gerfalcons; so that even as he sits therein upon
his chair of state or other seat, if he sees any birds pass he lets
fly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_642" id="Page_642">[642]</a></span> his hawks at them. And none may dare to approach within a stone's
throw of the carriage, unless those whose duty brings them there. And
thus it is that the king travelleth."</p>


<h4>"<span class="smcap">A Sunless Sea.</span>"</h4>

<p>Our English eyes, loving light, weary a little of the short cold days
in our country, when the sun makes "winter arches." Sadder still would
be our state in the regions told of by Marco Polo in the following
passage:</p>

<p>"Beyond the most distant part of the territory of the Tartars, ...
there is another region [thick set with dark impenetrable woods] which
extends to the utmost bounds of the north, and is called the Region
of Darkness, because during most part of the winter months the sun
is invisible, and the atmosphere is obscured to the same degree as
that in which we find it just about the dawn of day, when we may be
said to see and not to see. The men of this country are well made and
tall, but of a very pallid complexion. They are not united under the
government of a king or prince, and they live without any established
laws or usages, in the manner of the brute creation. Their intellects
also are dull, and they have an air of stupidity. The Tartars often
proceed on plundering expeditions against these people, to rob them of
their cattle and goods. For this purpose they avail themselves of those
months in which the darkness prevails, in order that their approach may
be unobserved; but, being unable to ascertain the direction in which
they should return homeward with their booty, they provide against the
chance of going astray by riding mares that have young foals at the
time, which latter they suffer to accompany the dams as far as the
confines of their own territory, but leave them, under proper care, at
the commencement of the gloomy region. When their works of darkness
have been accomplished, and they are desirous of revisiting the region
of light, they lay the bridles on the necks of their mares, and suffer
them freely to take their own course. Guided by maternal instinct, they
make their way directly to the spot where they had quitted their foals;
and by these means the riders are enabled to regain in safety the
places of their residence."</p>

<h4 id="note_411"><a href="#sn_411">411</a>. "<span class="smcap">The Golden Vanity.</span>"</h4>

<p>This is a patchwork of stanzas from three versions of the old ballad.
In one version the "Golden Vanity" is said to be the " Sweet Trinity,"
and to have been built by Sir Walter Raleigh in the Netherlands.
According to yet another, the Cabin-boy, after threatening to sink the
"Goulden Vanitie" as he had "sunk the French gallee," is taken on board
and the Captain and merchant adventurers proved "far better than their
word." But if stanza 12 is any witness, this seems unlikely. Can one
not actually <i>see</i> the cold faces mocking down upon the water?</p>


<h4 id="note_412"><a href="#sn_412">412</a>.</h4>

<p>To an eye and ear new to them, these old Scottish ballads may seem a
little difficult and forbidding. But read on, and their enchantment has
no match&mdash;the very strangeness of the words, the rare music, the colour
and light and clearness and vehemence, and, besides these, a wildness
and ancientness like that of an old folk-tune which seems to carry with
its burden as many lost memories as an old churchyard has gravestones.
The stories they tell are world wide. How they came into that world
(for of some of them there are as many as twenty to thirty different
versions), how they have fared in their long journey, and even when and
by whom they were made, are still questions on which even scholars are
not yet agreed.</p>

<p>"Kevels" in line 5 of "Brown Robyn," means <i>lots</i>, and recalls a far
older story:</p>

<p>"Now the word of the Lord came unto Jonah the son of Amittai, saying,
Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it; for their
wickedness is come up before me. But Jonah rose up to flee unto
Tarshish from the presence of the Lord, and went down to Joppa; and he
found a ship going to Tarshish, so he paid the fare thereof, and went
down into it, to go with them unto Tarshish from the presence of the
Lord.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_645" id="Page_645">[645]</a></span> But the Lord sent out a great wind into the sea, and there was a
mighty tempest in the sea, so that the ship was like to be broken. Then
the mariners were afraid, and cried every man unto his god, and cast
forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea, to lighten it of
them. But Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship; and he lay,
and was fast asleep.... And they said every one to his fellow, Come,
and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil is
upon us. So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah.... Then said
they unto him, What shall we do unto thee, that the sea may be calm
unto us? for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous. And he said unto
them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so shall the sea be
calm upon you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon
you.... So they took up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea; and the
sea ceased from her raging."</p>


<h4 id="note_415"><a href="#sn_415">415</a>. "<span class="smcap">A Seal My Father Was.</span>"</h4>

<p>Notes of music for the enticement of seals, with other beautiful old
Gaelic airs and poems and tales, will be found in Journals 23/5 of The
Folk-Song Society, collected by Mr. Martin Freeman.</p>


<h4 id="note_418"><a href="#sn_418">418</a>. "<span class="smcap">Sir Patrick Spence.</span>"</h4>

<p>The longer version of the ballad into which the genius of Sir Walter
Scott wove a few new stanzas is the better known. But this, I think, is
the best. Indeed, the secret art of this naked and lovely poetry seems
nowadays to be lost: its marvel is how much it tells by means of the
little it says.</p>


<h4>"<span class="smcap">Late, Late Yestreen.</span>" (stanza 7)</h4>

<p>With money in his pocket and bewaring of glass, the Man of
Superstitions bows low and seven times to the new moon. If he sees a
dim cindrous light filling in the circle of which this crescent is the
edge, he "looks out for squalls"&mdash;the new moon has "the auld moone in
hir arme." That light is the earth-shine. The sun illumines the earth;
the earth like a looking-glass reflects his radiance upon the moon;
and she thus melancholily returns it; whereas the silver blaze on her
eastern edge is light direct: eyes looking upward thence into her black
skies are lit with her prodigious mornings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_646" id="Page_646">[646]</a></span></p>


<h4 id="note_419"><a href="#sn_419">419</a>. "<span class="smcap">Allison Gross.</span>"</h4>

<p>Here I have changed only two words of the original.</p>


<h4 id="note_420"><a href="#sn_420">420</a>. "<span class="smcap">Sir Hugh.</span>"</h4>

<p>If this ballad tells of a fact, then the young Sir Hugh was beguiled
out of his life by the dark beautiful Jewess in the year 1255. The
story comes from a monastery, and it is historically certain that the
wealthiest Jews of Lincoln were in this year crucified on this charge.
True or false, what a clear, pellucid picture the ballad builds up in
the imagination&mdash;the ancient town; the boys at their game; the narrow,
gabled, cobbled streets; the evening gold on roof and wall; night;
lamentation; and the clanging of the bells.</p>


<h4 id="note_421"><a href="#sn_421">421</a>. "<span class="smcap">Edward.</span>"</h4>

<p>The spelling of this ballad usually begins "Why dois your brand sae
dripp wie bluid," and so on. This spelling Professor Child thought
"affectedly antique." But since, as he says, mere antiquated "spelling
will not make an old ballad, so it will not <i>un</i>make one." And "Edward"
in any guise is "one of the noblest" of the popular ballads. Here it
is, then, in our own spelling for proof.</p>


<h4 id="note_422"><a href="#sn_422">422</a>. "<span class="smcap">I will sing.</span>"</h4>

<p>The king in the third line is James the Sixth of Scotland and the First
of England&mdash;the king, according to the old waggery, "who never said a
foolish thing and never did a wise one." But see Green. The "wanton
laird of young Logie" is John Wemyss who plotted against him with the
Earl of Bothwell in 1592. His bold, crafty and merry young wife, May
Margaret, says Mr. Sidgwick, had one of these four delectable maiden
names&mdash;Vinstar, Weiksterne, Twynstoun, or Twinslace. It is dubious
which.</p>

<p>All ladies in those old days carried knives at their girdles. The one
in stanza 8 was clearly a wedding gift. And to judge from the ballads,
doughty uses they sometimes put them to.</p>


<h4 id="note_423"><a href="#sn_423">423</a>. "<span class="smcap">Fair Annie.</span>"</h4>

<p>In the margins of Mr. Nahum's copy of this ballad, two exquisite
damosels were painted in green, blue and amethyst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_647" id="Page_647">[647]</a></span> on gold (as in a
monk's work), and between their fingers hung a linen napkin seemingly
broidered with pearls and in the midst of it a sleeping dove. Whatever
he may have meant by this, I confess that at first reading I fell
in love with both these ladies. My feelings for the "noble knight"
who ransomed fair Annie, then wearied of her, were different. It
was strange to find a noble knight so hard a gentleman, not so much
because he wearied of her (since to weary of one so true, intelligent
and tender was even more of a punishment than a misfortune) but most
particularly, with regard to his craving for "gowd and gear." He
reminds me of a similar piece of humanity described in three short
stanzas which were found by Mr. Macmath written on the fly-leaf of a
little volume printed at Edinburgh about 1670, and which <i>I</i> found in
Child's Ballads:</p>

<h4 id="note_429"><a href="#sn_429">429</a>. "<span class="smcap">That birk Grew fair eneugh.</span>" (stanza 6)</h4>

<p>The strangest feature of these ballads is that the stories they tell,
the customs, beliefs, lore they refer to, may be found scattered up and
down all over the world. In Russia, for one small instance, the birk or
birch tree is honoured in this fashion: A little before Whitsuntide,
says Sir James Fraser in <i>The Golden Bough</i>, the young women, with
dancing and feasting, cut down a living birch-tree, deck it with bright
clothes or hang it with ribbons; then set it up as an honoured guest in
one of the village houses. On Whit Sunday itself they fling it, finery
and all, into a stream for a charm.</p>

<p>And now for England: "Thirty years ago," says Mrs. Wright, "it was
still customary in some west-Midland districts to decorate village
churches on Whit Sunday with sprigs of birch stuck in holes bored in
the tops of the pews. I can remember this being done by an old village
clerk in Herefordshire, but when he was gathered to his fathers in the
same profession, the custom died with him." How happy must he have been
then&mdash;as happy as for that one evening was the Wife of Usher's Well
herself&mdash;to lift his eyes upon a silver birch brushing with its green
tresses the very gates of Paradise!</p>

<p>If the daisies are not to shut their eyes until Julia shut hers, should
they not most assuredly wait also until "dear love Isabella," shut
<i>hers</i>? She was the bosom friend and aunt of Marjorie Fleming, Sir
Walter Scott's little friend, who was born in 1803, and who, having
written her few tim-tam-tot little rhymes, died in 1811. And here is
Isabel:</p>

<p>For to grow old and look back on one's childhood, though in much it
is a happy thing, may be also a thing full of dread and regret. The
old poets never wearied of bidding youth gather its roses, seize its
fleeting moments. But not all roses are fresh and fragrant in the
keeping, and "lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds."</p>


<h4 id="note_440"><a href="#sn_440">440</a>. "<span class="smcap">Afterwards.</span>"</h4>

<p>Every fine poem says much in little. It packs into the fewest possible
words&mdash;by means of their sound, their sense, and their companionship&mdash;a
wide or rare experience. So, in particular, with such a poem as this.
It tells of a man thinking of the day when he shall have bidden goodbye
to a world whose every live and lovely thing&mdash;Spring, hawk, evening,
wintry skies&mdash;he has dearly loved. And if what it tells of is to be
seen as clearly and truly as if it were before one's very eyes, it
must be read intently&mdash;all one's imagination alert to gather up the
full virtue of the words, and to picture in the mind each fleeting and
living object in turn.</p>

<p>As I write these lines I cannot refrain from suggesting how thankful we
should be to be living in a day when three great poets, who have been
long in the world, are adding to the riches of English poetry&mdash;Thomas
Hardy, Charles Doughty, and the Poet Laureate, Robert Bridges. It is
but a little while, too, since the death of that exquisite writer, and
lover of all things true and beautiful, Alice Meynell, and of W. H.
Hudson, who was no less a poet because he wrote not in verse but in
prose.</p>

<p>To compare the great things of one age with the great things of another
is an exceedingly difficult task (and to pit poet against poet, or
imagination against imagination, an exceedingly stupid one). But that
in Elizabeth's day England was indeed a "nest of singing birds" may
be realised by the fact that when Shakespeare was finishing his last
play, <i>The Tempest</i>, in the Spring, apparently, of 1611&mdash;when, that
is, he himself was aged 47 (and his Queen had been eight years dead),
Sir Walter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_654" id="Page_654">[654]</a></span> Raleigh was 59, Anthony Munday 58, Samuel Daniel 49,
Michael Drayton 48, Thomas Campion 44, Thomas Dekker (?) 41, John Donne
and Ben Jonson were 38, John Fletcher was 32, Francis Beaumont 27,
William Drummond 26, John Ford 25, William Browne and Robert Herrick
20, Francis Quarles 19, George Herbert 18, Thomas Carew (?) 16, James
Shirley 15, and John Milton (and Sir John Suckling) were 2. It was
seven years before the birth of Richard Lovelace and Abraham Cowley,
ten before Marvell's, and eleven before Vaughan's. Edmund Spenser had
been twelve years dead, Sir Philip Sidney twenty-five&mdash;and Chaucer 211.</p>

<p>Two hundred and fifty years afterwards&mdash;in 1861&mdash;another great queen
was on the Throne, Victoria. It was the year in which the Prince
Consort died, and Edward, Prince of Wales, came of age. Nor was
England's garden silent then: for in that year William Barnes and
Cardinal Newman were 60, Edward Fitzgerald and Tennyson were 52, Robert
Browning 49, Charles Kingsley 42, Matthew Arnold 39, Coventry Patmore
38, William Allingham 37, Dante Gabriel Rossetti and George Meredith
were 33, Christina Rossetti was 31, William Morris 27, Algernon
Swinburne 24, Mr. Thomas Hardy was 21, Mr. Robert Bridges 17, Robert
Louis Stevenson 11, and Francis Thompson was 2. Other great writers, in
English, then alive were Carlyle, Thackeray, Dickens, Ruskin, Darwin
and Huxley; Emerson, Hawthorne, Longfellow and Walt Whitman. So the
strange flame of genius fitfully burns in this world. And 1611 knew as
little of 1861 as 1861 knew of 2111. (But would that 1923 could leave
to the future one-tenth part of such a legacy as did 1611&mdash;the English
Bible!)</p>

<p>But to return to Shakespeare. He was born in April 1564. About 1591
he wrote the first of his plays, <i>Love's Labour's Lost</i>. By 1611 he
had finished the last of them; 34 in all as they appear in the first
Folio, 37 as they now appear in the Canon. And apart from these, his
Poems. There followed a strange silence. On the 25th of March, 1616,
"in perfect health and memory (God be praised!)," he made his will.
On St. George's Day, 1616, he died. To reflect for a moment on that
brief lifetime, on that twenty years' work which is now a perennial
fountain of happiness, light and wisdom to the whole world, is to
marvel indeed. The life-giving secret of this supreme genius none can
tell. We know not even our own. But there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_655" id="Page_655">[655]</a></span> is a story told by Thomas
Campbell: "It was predicted of a young man lately belonging to one of
our universities, that he would certainly become a prodigy because he
read sixteen hours a day. 'Ah, but,' said somebody, 'how many hours
a day does he <i>think</i>?' It might have been added, 'How many hours
does he feel?'" So of Shakespeare. As, then, said his old friends and
fellow-players, John Heminge and Henry Condell in their Preface to the
Folio: "Reade him, therefore; and againe, and againe: And if then you
doe not like him, surely you are in some manifest danger...."</p>

<p>These lines and the stanzas that follow them in the <i>Elegy in a Country
Churchyard</i> are as familiar as any in English, and may be found in
almost every collection of poems. Here, "a figure on paper"&mdash;from a
letter to a friend written by the author of them, Thomas Gray, on
November 19, 1764, is a description&mdash;not of evening after the setting
of the sun&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_656" id="Page_656">[656]</a></span> but of a sun-<i>rise</i> as vivid as if one's own naked eye
had watched its "Levee":</p>

<p>I must not close my letter without giving you one principal event of
my history; which was, that (in the course of my late tour) I set out
one morning before five o'clock, the moon shining through a dark and
misty autumnal air, and got to the sea-coast time enough to be at the
Sun's Levee. I saw the clouds and dark vapours open gradually to right
and left, rolling over one another in great smoky wreathes, and the
tide (as it flowed gently in upon the sands) first whitening, then
slightly tinged with gold and blue; and all at once a little line of
unsufferable brightness that (before I can write these five words)
was grown to half an orb, and now to a whole one, too glorious to be
distinctly seen. It is very odd it makes no figure on paper; yet I
shall remember it, as long as the sun, or at least as long as I endure.
I wonder whether anybody ever saw it before? I hardly believe it."</p>

<p>So each day, one remembers, the sun rises, indeed is rising always
above <i>some</i> watchful eye's horizon, and we come so to expect its
rising, and so to be assured of it, as though it were no less certain
than that twice two are four. But, in fact, it is only just certain
enough to prevent night from being a dreadful apprehension, and life
from becoming a mere routine. As Coleridge says in his <i>Table Talk</i>:</p>

<p>"Suppose Adam watching the sun sinking under the western horizon for
the first time; he is seized with gloom and terror, relieved by scarce
a ray of hope that he shall ever see the glorious light again. The next
evening, when it declines, his hopes are stronger, but still mixed with
fear; and even at the end of a thousand years, all that a man can feel
is a hope and an expectation so strong as to preclude anxiety."</p>

<p>the Man in the Moon stands up there stark and still in her

<h4>"<span class="smcap">Are Beauties there as proud as here they be.</span>" (line 11)</h4>

<p>... The palace of her father the King, was on that side the Moon no
mortal sees, and of such an enchantment was her cold beauty that on
earth none resembles it. Yet all her flattery and pride was but to win
the idolatrous love of far-travelling Princes, or even of wanderers
of common blood; for the sake of that love and admiration only. And
many perished in those rock-bound deserts and parched and icy lunar
wildernesses on account of this proud damsel; before a strange fate
befell her....</p>

<p>Here, too, is a fragment (from a thirteenth century MS.), to be found
in <i>A Medieval Garner</i>:</p>

<p>"What shall we say of the ladies when they come to feasts? Each marks
well the other's head; they wear bosses like horned beasts, and if any
have no horns, she is a laughing stock for the rest. Their arms go
merrily when they come into the room; they display their kerchiefs of
silk and cambric, set on their buttons of coral and amber, and cease
not their babble so long as they are in the bower.... But however well
their attire be fashioned, when the feast is come, it pleases them
nought; so great is their envy now and so high grows their pride, that
the bailiff's daughter counterfeits the lady.'"</p>


<h4 id="note_450"><a href="#sn_450">450</a>. "<span class="smcap">She hath no Air.</span>" (line 5)</h4>

<p class="p-left">&mdash;and that being so:</p>

<p>".... There will be no sounds on the moon.... Even a meteor shattering
itself to a violent end against the surface of the moon would make
no noise. Nor would it herald its coming by glowing into a 'shooting
star,' as it would on entering the earth's atmosphere. There will be
no floating dust, no scent, no twilight, no blue sky, no twinkling of
the stars. The sky will be always black and the stars will be clearly
visible by day as by night. The sun's wonderful corona, which no man on
earth, even by seizing every opportunity during eclipses, can hope to
see for more than two hours in all, in a long lifetime, will be visible
all day. So will the great red flames of the sun.... There will be no
life (since) for fourteen days there is continuous night, when the
temperature must sink away down towards the absolute cold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_660" id="Page_660">[660]</a></span> of space.
This will be followed without an instant of twilight by full daylight.
For another fourteen days the sun's rays will bear straight down, with
no diffusion or absorption of their heat, or light, on the way...."</p>

<p>This is a matter-of-fact fragment out of "The Outline of Science,"
edited by Professor J. Arthur Thompson; but it would not be easy to say
exactly how in its magical <i>effect</i> on the mind it differs from poetry.
Indeed, there can hardly be a quicker journey to the comprehension of
scientific fact than by way of the imagination. Moonless mountainous
Hesper, the Evening Star, is an even lovelier thing to watch shining in
the fading rose and green of sunset when we realise that at her most
radiant&mdash;a radiance that casts an earthly shadow even&mdash;it is but a
slim crescent of the planet that we see, a planet, too, almost sister
in magnitude to the earth, but whose briefer year is of an ardour
that might be happiness to fiery sprite and salamander, but would be
unendurable to watery creatures like ourselves. Nor could language be
used more scientifically (concisely, pregnantly and exactly), than in
the words <i>moving</i>, <i>human</i>, <i>mask</i>, in the following sonnet by John
Keats&mdash;a sonnet written in mortal illness and in immortal sorrowfulness:</p>

they were made in the beginning of time, and be now six thousand years
old, have they one wrinkle of age in their face, one sob of weariness
in their lungs. They are <i>primogeniti Dei</i>, God's eldest sons...."</p>

<h4 id="note_459"><a href="#sn_459">459</a>.</h4>

<p>This is the Song sung by his guardian Angel to a young sleeping Prince
who has been cheated of his inheritance. It was printed by Charles
Lamb in his <i>English Dramatic Poets</i>, from a Tragedy entitled <i>The
Conspiracy</i>, written by Henry Killigrew when he was seventeen.</p>


<h4 id="note_460"><a href="#sn_460">460</a>. <span class="smcap">The Legend of St. Mark.</span></h4>

<p>The relics of this Saint, who for his miracles was thought to be a
sorcerer, and was murdered by a mob, were interred in Alexandria.
Hundreds of years afterwards these relics were coveted by the Venetians
by reason of the story that the Saint had once visited their city and
had heard speak to him an angel: <i>Pax tibi, Marce. Hic requiescet
corpus tuum</i>. At length two Venetian merchants, having persuaded
the Alexandrians that the sacred bones lay in danger of the raiding
Saracens, travelled back with them to their own city, where they
were reinterred with solemn ceremony in St. Mark's. This church was
afterwards burned to the ground, and the relics were lost. A century
passed; a wondrously beautiful church had arisen from the ashes of
the old, and during the ceremony held in the faith that it would be
revealed where they lay hid, suddenly a light shone forth from one of
the great piers, there was a sound of falling masonry, and, lo, the
body of the Saint, with arm outstretched, as if at finger's touch he
had revealed his secret resting-place.</p>


<h4>"<span class="smcap">Doves of Siam, Lima mice,<br />
     And legless birds of Paradise.</span>" (p. 470.)</h4>

<p>What particular kinds of doves and mice Keats had in mind here I cannot
yet discover. But, according to Topsell, mice are of these kinds: the
short, small, fearful, peaceable, ridiculous, rustik, or country mouse,
the urbane or citty mouse, the greedy, wary, unhappy, harmefull, black,
obscene, little, whiner, biter, and earthly mouse. Mice, too, he says,
are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_664" id="Page_664">[664]</a></span> "sometimes blackish, sometimes white, sometimes yellow, sometimes
broune and sometimes ashe colour. There are white mice amonge the
people of Savoy, and Dolphin in France, called alaubroges, which the
inhabitants of the country do beleev that they feede upon snow." Then,
again, "the field mouse, the farie, with a long snout; and the sleeper,
that is of a dun colour and will run on the edge of a sword and sleep
on the point."</p>

<p>What Topsell meant by "whiner" I am uncertain, but it may be he refers
to the mouse that sings. That is a habit quite distinct from the common
squeaking, shrilling and shrieking. It resembles the slow low trill of
a very distant and sleepy canary, but sweeter and more domestic, and
is as pleasant a thing to hear behind a wainscot, as it is to watch
the creatures gambolling. Why women are apt to fear these tiny beasts
is a mystery. But whatever mischief their ravagings may cause, may I
never live under a roof wherein (Cat or no Cat) there is no inch of
house-room for Mistress Mouse!</p>

<p>The fable that the Bird of Paradise is "legless" was set abroad by
travellers who had seen in old days its exquisite dismembered carcase
prepared for merchandise. It is hard to explain that Man, capable
of imagining a bird "whose fixed abode is the region of the air,"
sustaining itself "solely on dew," can also slaughter it and tie it up
in bundles for feminine finery. But so it is.</p>


<h4>"<span class="smcap">At Venice</span>...." (p. 471)</h4>

<p>So Keats left&mdash;unfinished&mdash;this, one of the happiest of his poems.
There are others in this volume: but not the <i>Eve of St. Agnes</i>, or
<i>Hyperion</i>, or the odes, <i>to a Nightingale, on a Grecian Urn</i>, or the
strange <i>On Melancholy</i>. Nor are any of his Letters here&mdash;as full a
revelation of the powers and understanding of that rare mind, as the
poems are of his imagination.</p>

with their Crown and Net, their Phoenix and Peacock, hold dear the
Southern Cross. It marks their very home.</p>

<p>And, once more, let me repeat what Miss Taroone said to me: Learn the
common names of every thing you see, Simon; and especially of those
that please you most to remember: then give them names also of your own
making and choosing&mdash;if you can. Mr. Nahum has thousands upon thousands
of words and names in his mind and yet he often fails to understand
what I say to him. Nor does he always remember that though every snail
is a snail and a Hoddydoddy, and every toad is a toad and a Joey, and
every centipede is a centipede and a Maggie-monyfeet, each is just as
much only its own self as you, Simon, are You.</p>

<p>"I thank God for my happy dreams," wrote Sir Thomas Browne in the
<i>Religio Medici</i>, "as I do for my good rest.... And surely it is not a
melancholy conceit [or fancy] to think we are all asleep in this world,
and that the conceits of this life are as mere dreams to those of the
next as the phantasms of the night to the conceits of the day. There is
an equal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_666" id="Page_666">[666]</a></span> delusion in both, and the one doth but seem to be the emblem

soul...."</p>

<p>And so&mdash;like the mediaeval traveller who had made a complete circuit
of the world without knowing it&mdash;we have come back to the place which
we started from. "The Elephant," says Topsell, in his <i>Historie of
Foure-footed Beastes</i>, "is delighted above measure with sweet savours,
ointments, and smelling flowers, for which cause their Keeper will in
the summer time lead them into the meadows of flowers, where they of
themselves will by the quickness of their smelling, choose out and
gather the sweetest flowers, and put them into a basket if their Keeper
have any....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_668" id="Page_668">[668]</a></span></p>

<p>(Having sought) out water (wherewith) to wash themselves, (they will)
of their own accord return back again to the basket of flowers, which,
if they find not, they will bray and call for them. Afterward, being
led into their stable, they will not eat meat until they take off their
flowers and dress the brims of their manger therewith, and likewise
strew their room or standing place, pleasing themselves with their
meat, because of the savour of the flowers stuck about their cratch."
Mr. Nahum himself, it seems to me, might have written that. What was
his <i>Other Worlde</i> but such "a Basket of Flowers": the forthshowing
in formal beauty&mdash;in this world's soil, and beneath ministering rain,
sunshine and dew&mdash;of the imaginations of men? Even Miss Taroone could
have uttered a secret word or two in the great ear of the Elephants at
their cratch: and were there not in her garden at Thrae flowers beyond
telling?&mdash;William Blake's:</p>
